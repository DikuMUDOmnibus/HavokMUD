To make houses.


edit spec_assign.c     
   find the assign_rooms procedure.

   add the room # of the room to the structure, and the House procedure
   (just like the existing entries)

   then, edit the world file, and make sure that the room's name
   corresponds with the characters name.

   for example:

   Loki's bedroom is ok, because the characters name is the first X
   chars in the room's name, where x is the length of the character's name

   The bedroom of Loki   is NOT ok.  


adding monsters and objects.

Do not edit the obj and mob file while the game is up. the game reads info
from this file constantly, and will screw up if the file is altered.  
(it uses a byte count to index the file, so a change in 1 byte can screw
up everything.


to add new boards, you need to add a blank file, with the name

XXXX.messages


XXXX == the virtual # of the board.   So, the regular temple board
  (3099) has the corresponding file  3099.messages.


You also have to add the board to the assign_objs procedure in spec_assign


Item heaping: 

	needs to be changed, so that the only thing that is important is
	the description, item #, or mob # should be unimportant for
	differentiation.

Some running notes:

	I personally had to increase my file descriptors to something over the
standard 64 limit. To do this I had to re-build my kernal, you may or may not
have to do this. Speak with your sys-admin if your max file descriptors is
limited to 64. If you can't and you get a lot of people on the mud will crash
and the gdb debug will be hard to figure out, but basically the frame gets
fried and makes the tracking down the function impossible.

The purpose of this document is to provide the
information needed to set up and run HavokMUD
source code.  This document assumes some mud
experience, some experience in C, and some
experience using a Unix operating system.  If
you do not have experience in these fields, please
take the time to find a good tutorial on those
subjects.

You recieved the HavokMUD distribution in a single package,
the directories are set up as needed, there is no installation
needed.

MAKE : 
	You begin by typeing "make" in the src directory 
	(/havok/src).  This will compile the code.  It may 
	take a few minute depending on the speed of your 
	computer.
RUNNING THE GAME :
	After compiling, type ./dmserver in the src directory.
CONNECTING :
	There are several options for connecting to the mud once
	you have it running.  Since there are too many mud clients
	to detail each of them, this document will use telnet since
	it is standard on almost every computer.
	Telnet to localhost 4000.
	4000 is the default port for running HavokMUD.
MISC :
	When you create your first character, the character will
	be level 59.  After this first character, all characters
	will start at level 1.  Now that you have your level 59
	character, type wizhelp, this is a list of the commands
	available.  There is a wizhelp file for each of the
	commands listed accessable using: wizhelp command  
    	The following commands cannot be added to help files due
	to their nature:
		" - a shortcut for "think", the immortal communication
		    channel (think hey gods)
		# - is used to set the level or minimum position for
		    a command (# set advance level 55)
BUGMAIL :
	Set up bugmail by replacing Gordon with the name of the
	character that should recieve bugmail, at line 669 in
	mail.c
MOTD/WMOTD/INFO/NEWS :
	The message of the day, wizards message of the day, info 
	and news can be changed using the chtext command, or by 
	editing the files motd, wmotd, info, and news in the
	/havok/lib/ directory.
ADD_HELP   :
	each time someone attempts to call a helpfile that doesn't
	exist, an entry is added to ADD_HELP, you can see this file
	in game by first setting your wizreport value to 1
	(@wizreport character 1), this enables the character to use
	view to see the file (view help).
REIMB :
	the directory reimb must be present for characters to rent,
	this directory stores a copy of the character each time he
	rents.  In the event that a character loses his equipment
	due to a mud error, you can reset him to this state
	(reimb character)
LOGIN :
	You can set your login screen to whatever you choose by
	editing the file /havok/lib/login
CREDITS :
	You may add to the credits file, but you may not remove
	any information from it.

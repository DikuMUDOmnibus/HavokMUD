For help getting started and for information on setting up the
mud to run, see GET_STARTED.doc

This directory contains documentation on various aspects of the game.
These files are extremely outdated.  You should use caution when using
them since the code has been significantly changed and many parts do
not function as documented in these files.  We are working to provide
updated documents to replace these, and will release them as we complete
them.

Thanks,
The HavokMUD Staff

#27090
Broken Stairs~
   This level of the tower seems to have completely fallen away.  In fact,
it stands on no more than a few pieces of stone jutting out of the wall.  To
make it further up you will have to jump to the remaining steps and hope they
hold.  You had better move fast.  Figuring that the rest of the floor has
fallen away there is little doubt that the rest could go at any second.

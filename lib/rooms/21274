#21274
Ancient Road~
    Long ago, this road must have been a thoroughfare, as it is easily forty
feet across. The stones that form it are still in very good shape here, as the
elements have not been able to abuse it here as they have where it is exposed
to the open sky. The southern entrance of the road into the tunnel is now just
visible from here, framed against a background that looks like a wire mesh,
through which you get a glimpse of the open sky - at last! You can go south
towards the opening, or north, deeper into the mountain.

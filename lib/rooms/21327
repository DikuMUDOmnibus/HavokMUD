Central Hallway~
    There is a set of stairs emerging from the center of the hallway here, and
the hall itself forms a square around this stair exit, thus making the corridor
here resemble a room more than a simple hall. As elsewhere, there are empty
sconces in the walls for torches. There are doors to the east and west here,
though it looks like the doorframe to the east no longer has a door on it, and
the western door is ajar. The hallway continues to the north and south, though
it looks like it terminates shortly on both ends. The stairway leads down into
darkness.

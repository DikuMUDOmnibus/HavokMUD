Widows Walk~
	This is a square platform made of rusty, iron bars at the top of the
cottage.  A rail made of vertical spikes lines all sided.  From here you can 
see the gloomy form of the dark forest all about the cottage. The mist however
is far too thick to let you see far.  A small hatch leads down into the
cottage.

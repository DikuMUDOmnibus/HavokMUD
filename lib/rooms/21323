Guest's Quarters~
    This room was probably pretty nice at one time, though it looks like it
has been looted several times since the original residents left. At one time
it had a door, but it has since been wrenched off it's hinges and now lies on
the ground. There is a bed, with the stuffing ripped out and spread all over
the room, then covered with a fine layer of dust, like everything else in
here. There is also a desk, tipped over on one side with one of the legs torn
off completely. There's no sign of it now. Whatever other furtinure was here
at one time has either been stolen or smashed to bits. The only way out is
through the doorframe to the west.

desk~
It is empty, and not worth taking (it looks rather heavy, anyway).

bed stuffing~
Only the frame and board of the original bed remain intact, and they are
dinged and scratched. The stuffing looks like some kind of unspun cloth, and
has dryed out completely over time.

Hallway~
    This is the middle of a short hall leading north and south. There are iron bars
set into the east wall leading into what looks like a prison cell.  To the west are
some stairs carved out of the solid rock. They lead up. The engineering required
to manipulate the solid stone in this area so precisely impresses you. There are
sconces on the walls for torches, but there are no torches in them now, leaving
the hall dark except for your light.

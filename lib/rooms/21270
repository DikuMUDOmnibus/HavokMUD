Ancient Road~
    Long ago, this road must have been a thoroughfare, as it is easily forty
feet across. The stones that form it are still in very good shape here, as the
elements have not been able to abuse it here as they have where it is exposed
to the open sky. The tunnel stretches on beyond the range of your light to the
north and south, traveling straight and flat through the mountain's core. The
road is eerie here; it seems to have been untraveled for aeons.

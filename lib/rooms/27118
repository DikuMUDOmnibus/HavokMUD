The Crypt~
    You are in a large, stone crypt.  On stone slabs and in niches in the
walls are the bones of generations of dead giants.  Many of the bodies seem to
be fresh.  Three slabs set aside for kings appear to have bodies on them that
seem to have been here for the same period of time.  Some sort of disaster hit
this once-great tribe not long ago.

You see a long hall filled with rubble.

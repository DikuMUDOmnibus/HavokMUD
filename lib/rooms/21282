Barracks~
    This room clearly serves as a military barracks, where men (certainly some
kind of humanoid, from the shape of the bunks) sleep and spend some of their
free time.  There are several rows of bunks here, stacked two high for efficiency.
At the foot of each is a locker, most of which hang open, some of which are
twisted and battered - apparently from attempts of would-be looters.  You can
exit west, back to the rest of the barracks.

Bottom of the Underground Cavern~
   As you continue further along the bottom of the underground cavern you
notice a thick layer of algae all around you.  You cannot distinguish where
the cavern wall begins and ends.  Nothing is certain and your only exits appear
to be to the north and to the west.

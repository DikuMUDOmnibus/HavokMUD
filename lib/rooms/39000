The Entrance to the Temple~
   This is where all the trails end.  Branches lay all over the trail.
There is a temple in the distance,over 100 feet high.  The temple is very colorful.  
The colors it contain are brown,black,and white.  On the top of the temple there is a
figure.  This figures facials cant be seen from here so he can't be made out.  The
temple has pictures of dragons all over it fighting humans.  The only way you can
leave this room is if you walk to the west or east.

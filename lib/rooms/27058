Spider Gate~
   A thick stone wall rises to the north of you.  Looming at its center
stands a huge iron gate.  The gate looks tortured and rusted with age.  Atop
it are large barbed spikes.  The center of the gate is adorned with a thick,
heavy lock in the shape of a black widow.  Thick mats of webbing cover the
gate and obscures your view into what lays beyond.  Just to the west is a 
small clearing.

You hack away the thick webbing and see an overgrown oak grove filled with
spider webs.

The clearing is obscured by a thick dome of dead branches that encircle the
ring of stones.

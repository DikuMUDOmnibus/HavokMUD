North Meadow~
	You are at the north end of a lush green meadow.  The forest rises above
you on all sides.  A steep hill rises to the north and a small foot path is
just south of here.  Further south of you a simple little cottage stands with
smoke curling out of it's chimney.  A vegetable garden grows by a small well
just north of the cottage.

The top of the hill is lush and green.  A small path enters the forest from
there.

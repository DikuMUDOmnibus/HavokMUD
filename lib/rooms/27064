The Circle of Standing Stones~
	You are standing in the circle of stones.  Each one is roughly 
rectangular and standing about 20 feet tall.  At the edge of your hearing 
you can make out an almost inaudible humming.  A deep sadness seem to
emanate from all around.  A small unadorned stone alter rests in the center
of the circle.  To the north a huge wall of thorns stands running east and
west.  A small foot path wanders into just to the north and another runs
south toward a distant gate.

The path seems to lead to a clearing on the far side of the brush.

The gate looks rather ominous and foreboding.

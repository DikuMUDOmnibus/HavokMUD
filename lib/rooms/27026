Misty Yard~
	You stand in an open field filled with thick clumps of dead grass.
Just to the east is an aged, white picket fence.  The paint is peeling and
many of the wooden planks have been broken.  The cobblestone path runs into
the fence and beyond as well is disappearing to the west.  A smaller, muddy
path runs north and south.  The sky above you is blocked out by the thick
mist that fills the air.

The image of an old cottage can barely be seen through the mist.

The southern path looks very muddy and wet but rather unused.

The fence must have been bright and beautiful at some time but now has fallen
into deep decay.  It leans dangerously and is choked with weeds.

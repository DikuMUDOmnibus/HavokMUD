Throne of the Gritha Chief~
	Here is the throne of the chief and quasi-god of the gritha.  The
throne is crudely carved out of the southern wall of the box canyon.  Just
above the throne is a massive carving of the claw of Malar, god of Bloodlust.
The carving is far older that any of the other stone work you have seen here.
To the north is the fire.

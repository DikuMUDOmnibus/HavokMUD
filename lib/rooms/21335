Storage Room~
   This room is entirely made out of large red brick stones and pieces of dull
grey moss. It is apparently a storeroom, though it looks as if it has been
broken and have spilled their contents onto the floor. Unfortunately, it
looks like whatever they once held was perishable, because all that is left
now is shards of broken glass and stains on the stone floor. There are also
some wooden planks from broken barrels, along with a couple of barrels that
are still intact, lined up against the south wall.

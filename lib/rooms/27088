Base of the Tower~
   You are at the bottom of the crumbling tower of Azaran.  From the
rotting tapestries and furniture crushed by fallen rocks from the upper tower,
this must have once been a comfortable living area.  Large holes in the stone
walls have not kept the elements out and furniture has rotted heavily.  A
stone staircase leads to the second level of the tower.

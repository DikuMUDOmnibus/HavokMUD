The Clearing of The Hags~
	Dark magics swirl around you.  A thick mist bubbles out of the soil.
The trees around you are dead, frozen in a silent scream.  The forces at work
here a poisoned the land.  A black crow with red glowing eyes watches you
from it's perch in the tree.  This place has been totally consumed by evil.
You can see shadows of otherworldly creatures dancing about at the edge of you 
vision.

Path~
   The grassy jungle area has finnally stopped.  After emerging from that confusing area,
a well used path to the west suddently appeared.  It is probably quite obvious that from
the looks of that path, the natives are pretty use to running back and forth through that
maze like area.  A few trees still tower overhead.

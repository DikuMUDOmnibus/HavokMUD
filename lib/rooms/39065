Eastern Side Of The Bottom floor~
   This is the eastern side of the whole area.  It looks just like all the other rooms.
It feels like there is a breeze in here for the dirt is blowing around on the ground
All of a sudden a spider drops down on a web and grabs one of the little bugs
and yanks him back up and sucks the blood from it. The exits are north, south,
and west.

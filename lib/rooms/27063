Small Field~
	A small field of withered grass grows in this corner of the walled 
garden.  The black, twisted remains of an oak are still rooted here.  Many
small spiders have spun webs in the branches.  A thick thorn bush grows just
to the north of you.  It seem to fill the northern part of the garden.  A
thick cluster of oaks grow just to the south and a circle of monoliths stand
just to the west.

The stones are old and weathered.  Although the stand tall and proud is seems
as if they are filled with an unexplainable sadness.

The tree's blackened form, although quite dead seems to be almost screaming
out in agony.

Ershteep Road~
   You are standing on a thin trail only wide enough for two. The
trail was once, apparently, the middle of a large and busy
thoroughfare. It now lies overgrown by thick, impassable forest to
the east and west. The trail leads further north where a small
cottage becomes apparent and south, through the forest.  A bright
red ribbon stretches across the road, preventing travel northward.
A note flutters on the breeze.

The Temple and City of Saffron are currently under construction.
They will be opened when they are deemed safe enough for mortal
excursions.

The Queen's Garden~
Here is where Queen Katriana comes to spend time with her woodland friend and
to personally tend to this garden. You are surounded by plants of beauty
that is only surpassed by that of Queen Katriana. The wolves that have a
special kinship with the queen have a den to the east. To the north is the
greenhouse where the Queen keeps her very special plants. To the west is a
normal looking greenhouse.

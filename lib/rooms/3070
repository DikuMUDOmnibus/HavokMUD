Hall of Rules~
This is a list of rules for all players of ShadowDale.  You are expected to
know these rules well and follow them all the time.  Also check these rooms
now and then for any additions or changes to the rules.
 
1) If you have a problem or a question please read the help files, news, and
ask other mortals first before asking an immortal.  Most questions we get can
be answered by another mortal.
 
2) Player killing is illegal.  This includes such things as summoning a PC to
the purple worm to get them killed.  The only people who are allowed to kill
are people involved with the race war, then both people have given consent to
be killed.  There is never an excuse to kill someone, if you feel a problem
has reached that extend tell an immortal about it, never take a problem into
your own hands.
 
3) Stealing from another play is illegal.  Even if you know the person and
they are sitting right next to you in real life, its still illegal.  If you
must practice stealing go to a low level mob and practice.

Fork in the Road~
  A fork in the road stops your travels.   The decision to go south towards 
a foul odour or West towards the wonderful smell of seawater and the ocean is
mind-boggling.  The direction West is rather misleading though.  The smell of 
the sea can be smelt but West only seems to lead into some sort of weird jungle
terrain.
  A tall tree also looms overhead and the sound of some monkeys can heard from 
above and from the jungle to the west.

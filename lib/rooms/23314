Beautiful Valley Lake~
   The lake is glistening in the afternoon sun.  A mountain of
great height and size is towering though to the north.  The
mountain though is weird, the entire mountain side is envelped
full of cracks which emmit a strong fiery gold light where
even some heat emmit from it.  The water is also noticably
warmer than in other parts of the lake.

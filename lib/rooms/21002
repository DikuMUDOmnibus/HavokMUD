Ershteep Road~
   You are standing on a thin trail only wide enough for two. The
trail was once, apparently, the middle of a large and busy
thoroughfare. It now lies overgrown by thick, impassable forest to
the east and west. The trail leads further north where a small
cottage lies in a clearing and south towards the City of Mordilnia.

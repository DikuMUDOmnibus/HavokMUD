Gritha's Ceremonial Fire~
 A huge fire roars away here almost burning you.  Wood and bones
line the coals of this massive fire.  The air is filled with insane cries
and calls.  A path leaves to the north.  To the east is a tunnel carved into
the rock and to the west a natural cave lies.  Looming over the fire, just
to the south is a huge throne carved into the living rock of the canyon face.

A huge throne lies carved into the living rock just to the north.  Carved above
the throne is the image of Malar, god of bloodlust.

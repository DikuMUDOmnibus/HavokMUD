Pig Poles~
	Here at an intersection someone has staked half a dozen pig poles, each
over 12 feet tall, all topped with the heads of some hapless traveler.  A
spot of sky can be seen over head where these evil trees' branches thin.  The
trail itself runs to the east and south.  It looks as if someone has recently
broken through the brush to the west.

Infirmary~
    The purpose of the long flat beds you noticed from the corridor is clearer
now that you can get a better look at them, as is the purpose of the cabinets.
The beds are on rollers, and from what you can see in the cabinets that are open,
they are filled with linens and bandages.  This room is used as a medical facility.
Among the furniture here are several open storage cabinets, and a couple closed
ones.  There is an exit to the west.

beds~
The beds are on rollers, but they have rusted into their current position. At
one time the wounded were transported on them, you figure.

linens~
They are very old and moth-eaten, and what remains of them is covered with
a layer of dust.

cabinets~
The open cabinets have some old linens inside.

On the shore of a small island~
   This small island lies forgotten in the midst of the Dragonsea. A
sandy path leads north, across the island to what seems to be some
sort of a lagoon. The wind is brisk, but seems to carry an enticing
melody on it. To the south, the vast expanse of the Dragonsea stretches
out in every direction.

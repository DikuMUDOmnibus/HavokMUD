The Storage Room~
   Here is the storage room.  It looks like its been here longer then the temple
has.  It has the same designs as the temple does.  On the floor lays bones
from humans that have come here to test their skills hundreds of years
ago when the dragons ruled these lands.  Now the dragons have found
a new home in the heart of the world and now they stay there.

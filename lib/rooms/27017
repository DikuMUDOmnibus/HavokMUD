Canyon Path~
  The path here cuts through a stony canyon.  Dung and bits of fur are
scattered about, showing signs of much activity.  To the north is only silence
but the south is filled with hoots and animalistic cries.  A fire burns brightly
to the south.

You see a box canyon riddled with caves to the south.  A bon-fire burns
brightly at the end of the canyon.

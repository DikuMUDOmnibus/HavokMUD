Gloomy Clearing~
      This is a small opening in the woods.  The spongy ground smells of
decay.  Ferns grow thickly on the edge of the clearing.  The trail splits 
and disappears into the woods to the south, south, and east.  Dozens
of bones lie scattered at your feet.  Erie howls echo out of the forest.

The trail seems to grow muddy and dark further north.  You can here a 
chorus of frogs rising from that direction/

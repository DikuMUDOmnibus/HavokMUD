Further Down the Underground Cavern~
   As you travel further down the slope the light becomes almost non-existant.
The water becomes almost unbearably cold.  Rustling sounds in the distance are
amplified and echoed many times and consequently you are not quite sure exactly
the origin of any of them.  As you continue onwards you descend into complete
darkness.

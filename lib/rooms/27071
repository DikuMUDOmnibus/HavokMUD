The Queen's Domain~
	You stand in a large chamber covered in spider webs.  Spiders swarm on
every surface.  The floor is littered with pieces of bone and eaten animals.
Hanging in the webs around you are the cocooned forms of many human and
animal victims alike.  Many egg sacks litter the room.  The only exit is a 
tunnel to the east.

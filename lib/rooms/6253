Grand Entrance~
You are now in what is without a doubt the most beautiful castle you have ever
been in. The ceiling is so high that it is beyond distances that you are 
capable of seeing. Unlike other castles, the air here is fresh and clean. To
the north are the courtyards where the Elven nobles socialize and conduct
affairs of the state. The are large passages to the east and west.

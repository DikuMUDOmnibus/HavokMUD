Great Hall~
    This is the western end of a large dining hall the people of this fortress
use to feed their faces in.  The heavy wooden tables and sturdy benches of this
hall were made to withstand the a great deal of weight and abuse.  The roof here
is fairly high, as it is in the great hall section to the east, which is the only
exit from here.

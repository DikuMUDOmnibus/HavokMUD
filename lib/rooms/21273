Ancient Road~
    Long ago, this road must have been a thoroughfare, as it is easily forty
feet across. The stones that form it are still in very good shape here, as the
elements have not been able to abuse it here as they have where it is exposed
to the open sky. The ancient road continues to the north and south, straight
as ever in its course. The rock walls and smooth, and the stones along the
floor are flat and even, though worn from the passage of countless travelers,
long ago.

Jungle Road~
   This seems to be the beginning of a road.  It seems to be a jungle road.
Very strangly the road keeps going on in the east.  There is a temple
that is very far east.  The road is covered with vines,soil,and plants of
all sorts that block the path.  There is a wooden hut not very far from here
it seems it nice shape and looks like someone is living in it also.

Materra's Cavern at Lykos~
You are standing in what appears to be a cavern. Lights flicker from
torches ensconced on the rock walls. In the middle of the room sits a
chair made of bone, skulls decorating the back. On each side lies a
majestic black wolf, their eyes glowing green in the murky light. To
the left stands an armor case filled with various tools of pain. You
wonder casually what the half-full bottle of Wesson oil is doing here.
On the right, you notice a hearth built into the rock. The only
in this cold, damp chamber seems to come from its dying embers.

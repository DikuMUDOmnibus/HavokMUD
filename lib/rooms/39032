Bottom of the Underground Cavern~
   The slope of the descent levels off and you find yourself at the bottom of
the cavern.  There is no visible life around you.  The muffled scratching and
snorting is slightly louder than previously, but you still cannot seem to pinpoint
its origin.  You feel a current flowing past your skin that seems to be leading
to the east.

Inside Able's Cottage~
	This is the cottage of Able the Smith.  Here he works day in and day
out forging the finest of goods.  A large furnace burns sending wisps of
smoke rising up the chimney.  A simple cot is in the corner.  The stone floor
is littered with scraps of metal and pieces of coal.  The only exit is a door
on the west wall.

Large Cell~
    This is a large cell, surrounded by granite walls that look quite solid.  It
is quite chilly here, as the stone walls seem to radiate a coldness. A few
tapestries have been added to help fight off the chill. The cell has a bed made
of heavy oak bolted to the south wall and floor, and a very small hole in the
southwest corner for waste disposal. There is a curtain hung to the north to
give the occupants an illusion of privacy.

It is too dark to see very far into it, but you think you hear the faintest
trace of rushing water far below. There is no odor belying its function,
though its presence and position in the cell make that clear.

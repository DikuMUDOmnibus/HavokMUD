Guard Room~
    This is a circular, stone room.  The floor is a shiny black tile but
is old and has many cracks running through it.  A pair of large bronze doors
loom to the north.  An archway leads to a large room to the south of here.  The
doorway to the west seems empty and a foreboding feeling arises from it.
To the east is an ornately carved wooden door.

You see a short hall ending in a dark room... in the darkness you see a 
glinting light dancing about.

You see a room littered with rubble.  It is crowded with guards and a make-
shift throne stands on the southern edge.

The Hot Tub~
  You are soaking in a huge jacuzzi filled with steaming, hot water.  Glasses
of red and white wine line the edge of the tub.  You notice a plaque on the
wall, beside the tub.

plaque~
Don't talk to strangers,
Because they're only there to do you harm.
Don't write in starlight,
Because the words may come out real.
Don't hide in doorways,
You may find the key that opens up your soul.
Don't go to heaven,
Because it's really only hell.
Don't smell the flowers,
They're an evil drug to make you lose your mind.
Don't dream of women,
Because they'll only bring you down.

	This is a small room carved into a limestone wall.  A overpowering 
stench hits you as you enter.  The floor is littered with refuse and garbage.
The flies here are so thick that you can hardly see into the depth of the room.
Rats scurry in all directions.  Many a bone lies on the floor.

A thick, wooden door lies to the west.  It has a large lock and a barred
window.  Beyond the door you see large room full of refuse.

Canyon~
    The walls rise steeply above you almost 100 feet.  The stone all about is
made of deep reds and orange.  No plants grow here at all.  Just to the south
you see a huge fire raging.  A small archway leads steeply down to the west
from which a fierce smell rises.  The path leads north, out of the canyon, and
south, to the fire.

A huge fire blazes just to the south.  Beyond that is a massive throne carved
from the canyon wall.

Down the steep hill appears to be a refuse heap.  Stay away!

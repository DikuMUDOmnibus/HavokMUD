#27040
Misty Forest Path~
   Dark trees crowd around you and the evil mist chokes this unholy
area so completely that you cannot see more than a few feet.  Eyes peer
out at you from all directions.  What little of the trail you can make out
seems to continue north and south.  The smell of death is thick here.

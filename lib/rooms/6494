Sarc's Private Chamber~
You are surrounded by a sense of serenity and joy.  As you look around you
notice that the room is walled and floored by petals of the most fragrant and
exotic flowers.  There are two wine glasses resting atop the grand piano here.
Something tells you that you are safe here and distant from harm.  You notice
that there is a plaque here.

Blue Little Rose
You are crying...
I am trying
To let you know that I love you.
Sweet Little Rose
Let your petals sway
All your lonely days
In the wind of my heart-
I can help you see
What it's like to be
Taken from the cold
And where you grew up with me.
I can set you free
If your'll just run to me...
All the thorns will go away
If you'll stay with me
Little Rose

Fork in the Path~
	The path coming in from the west forks here.  One trail runs north
and the other south.  Planted in the center of the intersection is a stake
topped with a helmeted human skull.  No words accompany the marker but its 
meaning is painfully obvious.  The sounds of battle rise from the north.

stake skull~
It is the skull of a human warrior and appears to be several months old.
Someone just pierced the skull with a sharp stick and left it here.

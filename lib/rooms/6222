The shore of the dark river~
   You are standing on a road at the northern shore of the dark river.  The
road leads northwards, and the river flows just south of here.  It looks 
like there was a bridge crossing the river at the point, but the bridge
is long gone, perhaps a victim of a flood sometime in the past.

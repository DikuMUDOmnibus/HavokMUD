$$c0002Starlight's Forest Sanctuary~
  You find yourself standing in the middle of a gigantic forest.  Small
trails and pathways wind their way into the woods.  Overhead, weak beams
of sunlight shine through the thick canopy of leaves.  Off in the distance
you hear the sounds of splashing water and decide to investigate.
  An obscure little trail leads you into the middle of a clearing
surrounded by several ancient oak trees.  A tiny stream ends here, forming
a crystal clear pool of water.  At the waters edge sits Starlight, 
dangling her feet in the water and stroking the fur of a black cat that's
curled up in her arms.  As you enter the clearing, the cat looks up at you
with wise golden-green eyes, studies you for a moment, then goes back to
watching the fish.

pool~
  You edge closer to the pool of water, trying not to disturb Starlight.
As you reach the edge and peer into it, you can see all of Shadowdale as
if you were thousands of feet up in the air.  As you concentrate on the
picture, it begins to zoom in on a small patch of forest in a part of 
the world you've never seen before.  The picture has finally zoomed in 
far enough that you can make out two tiny figures sitting by the side
of a small pool of water.  One of the figures is sitting by the edge of
the pool and the other is knelt down beside it peering down into it.
You realize with a start that the picture is of you from above!  Your
concentration broken, the image disappears in a wave of ripples leaving 
an ordinary pool of water...

Misty Intersection~
	Several paths meet here.  One wanders into the trees to the south
while the other two vanish to the east and west.  Large rocks jut out
of the ground here making walking difficult.  The trees in this part of the
forest seem to be much older than the rest.  Long stands of lichen hang
from the moss covered trunks.

You can see a bend in the path west of here.  There seem to be a lot of flies!

Inside the Thorn Bush~
	You have to duck low to avoid being caught in the masses of thorns
and webbing all around you.  Small spiders swarm out of a large hole in the
ground.  They are everywhere!  Crawling on you and getting inside your armor!
There small bites are harmless but painful.

Only darkness can bee seen down the dark hole but you are sure there are a 
multitude of spiders waiting for you down there.

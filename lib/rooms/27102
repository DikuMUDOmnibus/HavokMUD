North End of the Great Hall~
    The size of this hall makes you gasp.  Your light cannot even reach
the ceiling and the echo of your speech and breathing only increases the
mystery.  Large stone columns support the arched walls and carvings of great
giant gods and goddesses are scattered about.  A tunnel leads east and west
and far to the south you can make out a huge archway.  A large stone door
rests to the north.

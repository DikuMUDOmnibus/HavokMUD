Outside the North Gate of Karsinya~
  You are by two tall towers that have been built into the city wall and
connected by a footbridge across a heavy wooden gate.  To the south, North
Market Street leads to the center of the city.  North leads you to the Palace
where King Karsin rules the land.  West and east is a trail that follows the
north wall of the city.  In the distance to the west you can just see the
spire of a magnificent tower looming above the trees.

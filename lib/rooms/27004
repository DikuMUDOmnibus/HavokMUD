North End of Glade~
	Here is an open field of dead grass.  A single pole, over 15 feet high,
has been placed here.  Mounted on its top is a human skull.  Thick brambles
clog the edges of the glade and the dark trees tower over them.  The trail
continues north-south but a foot path wanders off to the west.

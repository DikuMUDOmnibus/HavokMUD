Huge Hallway~
	This hall was carved right out of the living rock.  The ceiling is
about 20 feet above you.  All along the walls huge torches burn brightly.
Strange noises echo from deeper within the cave.  Daylight can be seen just
to the west and there in only darkness to the east.  The stone walls seem
very freshly carved.  This tunnel could not be more than a few years old.

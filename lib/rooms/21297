Officer's Quarters~
    This room is filled with bunks, like the barracks, but there are no double
bunks here, only singles. You also notice they are further spread apart than
in the regular barracks, thus fueling your conclusion that it is officers who
slept here. For each bunk there is a desk and mirror, though the mirrors are
detectable only by the frames they were once housed in and the fragments still
on the floor - they have all been broken. The desks hang open, some with their
drawers extracted, which explains the wood splinters all over the floor. The
officer's quarters continues to the west, and there is also an opening to a
corridor in the south wall.

bunks~
Like the other furniture here, they look like they have taken a beating.

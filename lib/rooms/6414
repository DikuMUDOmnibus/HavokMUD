Torturer Chamber~
The insturments of pain that lie here let you know beyond a doubt that this is
the torturer chamber. There is a black hooded figure with glowing red eyes here
that definately makes you think that it is not a good idea to stay in this room
too long. To the north is an ancient torturer device, and the prison cells lie
to the west.

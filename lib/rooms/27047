Base of a Huge Tree~
	A feeling of peace fill you as you see this beautiful tree.  It
stands a hundred feet tall.  Its huge trunk is covered by a thick mat of
bright green moss.  Its highest branches disappear into a bright fog.
Tall ferns and thick brush surround you on all sides.  You hear a bird song
above you.

King's Reception Area~
As you enter the room, the King's Secretary looks you over and asks, 'Do you
have an appointment?' She seems rather disgruntled and confused by keeping
track of all the people trying to see the king. To the east is the room
where visitors wait for their audience with the king, and to the west is the
throne room.

Wet Forest Trail~
    This open trail is crowned my lush, green vegetation.  Small pines
grow all around you and the hard, red branches of mansineata trees dangle over
you like loving arms.  The air is clear and fresh but an evil mist can be seen
down the western trail.  The forest opens into a lush green field just to the
south.

A steep, green field rolls down to the south into a small valley.  At the edge
of your vision you think you see a cottage nestled in the trees.

Weird Jungle~
   This seems to be the middle of the weird jungle terrain.  The mixture of
the tall jungle grasses and seaweed along with the sand of a beach is
evident.  The path continues eastward and westward.  The smell of the
ocean though is becoming more potent and the sounds of seagulls can be heard 
but not seen.

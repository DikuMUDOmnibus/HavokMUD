Beautiful Valley Lake~
   The lake is glistening in the afternoon sun.  A mountain of great height
and size is towering though to the north.  The mountain though is weird,
the entire mountain side is envelped full of cracks which emmit a strong fiery
gold light where even some heat emmit from it.  The water is also noticebly
warmer than in other parts of the lake.

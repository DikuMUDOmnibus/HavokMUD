Stables~
    This is the south wing of the outpost's stable area.  The ceiling here is
quite high, as it is in the other parts of the stables, stretching away almost
out of the range of your light source to detect.  The stalls the horses are
kept in here are made of wood, and are still in reasonably good shape.  Thirty
or so horses could probably be stored here at maximum capacity.  The only exit
is to the central stable area northwards.

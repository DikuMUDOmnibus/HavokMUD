Hallway~
    You are in a dark east-west hallway in the mountain defense station.  The
walls are smooth, cut from the solid rock here deep inside the mountain.  The
ceiling is high, almost fifteen feet. The corridor bends to both the east and
west.  There is also a larger opening in the north wall.

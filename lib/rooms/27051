Bloody Path~
	The ground of this dark, forest path is pooled with blood.  Some
new and some old.  Clouds of insects have come to feast here.  Some large
mushrooms grow at your feet.  There is an over grown trail that looks little
used to the east but the large path runs from south to north into small field 
from which the sounds of a fray can be heard.

Kitchen~
    Two large ovens dominate this room, along with the stove that occupies the
room's center. There are large iron pots all over the stove, and there are
several shelves and drawers in the cabinets along the walls that have other
kitchen utensils. The ovens are what draw your attention, though. They are
both along the south wall, but are so large as to stick out several feet into
the kitchen's center. They are about ten feet tall, and tower above you
impressively. They look like they would be capable of feeding an army, which
is good, because apparently that's what they did. There are two exits; east
through a small door to a hallway, and north to the mess hall.

They have kitchen stuff in them. It all looks very dusty.

utensils~
You know, knives and spoons and forks and stuff like that. Cheese graters,
pots and pans of various sizes. Kitchen stuff. Nothing of much interest to
anyone other than a cook.

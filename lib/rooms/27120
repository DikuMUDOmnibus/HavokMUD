Sleeping Chambers of the Giant Chief~
	You are in a large room carved out of stone.  A huge pile of sheep
skins lie here making a good bed.  A lion's skin hangs on the north wall.
The west wall is the hallway out.  Several human and animal heads have been
mounted on the south wall.  The east wall is barren.  On a table is a small
cage with the door swinging open.

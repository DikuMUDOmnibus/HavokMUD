Hidden Bedroom~
   This room is entirely unlike the rough, natural stone of the passages
that run through this portion of the fortress.  This room looks like it
was made with powerful magic a very long time ago.  The walls are covered 
with old, beautifully-made tapestries.  There is sturdy wooden furniture
that include a bed, table, chair, chest, and wardrobe.  All of them seem
to be magically preserved to withstand the ravages of time.

Entering the Seige Camp~
   This is very clearly the entrance to an army's war camp.  There seems to be at
least two guards on duty here at all times.  To the north you see a tent that is used
as the soldiers' living quarters.  The path through the camp continues to the east
and west they both lead to campfires.  The path to the south seems to lead to a very
large oak tree.

Old Vineyard~
	Long since overgrown with brush, the wild vines and the broken 
remains of the trellising indicate that this once was a small vineyard. The
stone wall runs to the south of you and makes a sharp turn northward just to
the west. To the east you can see the outlines of a gate on the southern wall
and to the north east some standing stones are visible.  To the north is a
large path of brambles.

If you follow the wall further north you will come to a thick hedge of wild
blackberries.~

The spider gate is just to the east.  A small north south path runs through
it.

wall~
The wall is made from large granite blocks.  It stands about 17 feet tall.
At even spacings accost the top of the wall are rusty iron spikes to dissuade
thieves from climbing it.

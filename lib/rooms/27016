#27016
Dark Intersection~
	Here two paths meet.  A large one going north and south a smaller trail
vanishing to the east.  The air here is thick with smoke. Howls and cries fill
the air.  Just to the south you hear a vast collection of shouts and cries.
Through the darkness of the woods you see some light shining from the south...
possibly a fire.

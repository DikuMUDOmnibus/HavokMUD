Dark Clearing~
	You stand in a dark circular clearing.  The sky is blocked out by a
dome of dark branches above you.  The clearing is marked out by a ring of
large stone blocks.  It looks as if this place might have been used for some
sort of ceremony in the recent past.  The dirt is covered with small hoof
prints and some blood has been spilt in the center of the circle.  An almost
impassable, overgrown trail leaves south.  Down a dark trail to the west
you can see some torches flickering.

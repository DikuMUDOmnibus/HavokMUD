The Throne of Tunx~
   High in the skies lays a throne room.  This throne belongs to a immortal.
The immortals name is Tunx.  You peer around all of Tunxs room and find
only a throne, guard, and a table.  This table has food all over and wine poured
into fancy crystal glasses.  Unlike anything else there is a dagger that the guard
wields.  No mortal could have the power to hold this dagger.  The throne is
decorated with jewels and rubies.

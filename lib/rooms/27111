Shrine to Malar~
	You stand in a large room.  Stone pillars surround you on all sides.
At the far west end is a huge statue of a bear-like beast standing over the
corpse of a devastated elf.  The alter is a huge stone claw reaching out of
the ground.  On it are the remains of a human soldier.  Candles line the
walls filling the room with an eerie light.  A fire burns in a pit before the
alter.

Air Elemental's Lair~
   As you enter the large marble room you are almost enveloped into a cyclone of
wind.  Brushing the hair from your eyes you notice a whirling mass of havok
terrorizing the room.  Although you cannot make out any bodily features, you feel
as though your every move is being watched.

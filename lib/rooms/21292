Stables~
    This is the north wing of the outpost's stable area.  The ceiling in this
area is quite high, as in the other parts of the stables, stretching away
almost out of the range of your light source to detect. There is a pile of
fresh hay on the ground in the southeast corner of the area.  The stalls the
horses were kept in here are made of wood, and are still in reasonably good
shape.  Thirty or so horses could probably be stored here at maximum capacity.
The only way out is to the central stable area to the south.

Thorn Bush~
   A huge blackberry bush grows to the north of you.  It stands about
15 feet tall.  It's numerous thorns convince you that trying to go further
north would be quite painful!  The brush is full of spider webs and multitudes
of small spiders are scurrying out from under the bush.  To the south a 
large patch of brush grows.  And to the west you can see a mystic-looking
circle of monoliths standing tall in this cursed grove.

It appears that there is a opening inside the thorn bush.  Maybe you could
crawl in!

The stones look old and sad.  They almost seem to be waiting for something.

The brush is rather thick and you see the fragments some old wood scattered
about.

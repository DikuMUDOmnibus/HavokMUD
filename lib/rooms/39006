The End of the Grand Hallway~
   You have reached the end of the immense hallway.  Directly in front of you hangs
a gigantic tapestry of a majestic black dragon.  In the background can be seen four
winged creates that, strangely enough, look vaguely familiar.  You cannot help
but marvel at the magnificent armor that adorns the dragon lord.  On either side of
you is pearched a stone gargoyle, each clutching what appears to be a human skull.

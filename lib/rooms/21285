Hallway~
    You are in a dark north-south hallway in the mountain defense station.  The
walls are smooth, cut from the solid rock here deep inside the mountain.  The
ceiling is high, almost fifteen feet. The floor is flat and covered with dirt.
The hallway opens up to the south into a large area, to the north it looks like
it bends to the west. There is an opening in the east wall, through which you can
see the bunks and lockers of a military barracks.

#21275
At the gate~
    Long ago, this road must have been a thoroughfare, as it is easily forty
feet across. The stones that form it are still visible through the grass that
seems to have grown up through the cracks here and there, nourished by the
light that comes through the tunnel entrance to the south. The mouth where the
road enters the mountain here is blocked by a series of crosshatched bars of
a strange black metal. Each bar is a little less than two inches in width, and
they are spaced two feet apart, creating a square grid through which you can
see the countryside beyond. In the center of this is a gate, easily twenty feet
across and high, of the same crosshatched material, set into a rectangular
metal frame. There is no apparent lock on the gate.

Barracks~
    This room clearly serves as a military barracks, where men can sleep and spend
some of their free time.  There are several rows of bunks here, stacked two high to
maximize the space in the room.  There is an opening in the south wall leading into
more barracks.

bunks lockers~
The bunks and lockers look they were chewed up, swallowed, partially digested,
and vomited back up. There's very little left of them.

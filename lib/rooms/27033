Edge of the Forest~
	You stand at the top of a lush hill with forest on three sides.  A
trail disappears into the dark forest to the north and to the south the field
opens into a beautiful meadow.  The great, open sky shines above you filling 
you with relief.  South of here you see a well and a cottage.

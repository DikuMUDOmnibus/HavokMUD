Dark Pool~
	You stand in a circle of dead trees, all ringing a small pool of 
water.  The pool seems rather unspectacular and could be no more than a foot 
deep put there seems to be a strange aura that surrounds it.  There is only
silence here withe the exception of the large insects buzzing about.

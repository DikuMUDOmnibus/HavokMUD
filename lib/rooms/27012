Winding Trail~
	This trail is thick and overgrown.  The underbrush around you
is full of brambles and very large ferns.  Twisted branches rise over you,
blocking out your view of the sky.  The trail disappears into darkness
to the east and to the west.  The insects seem fewer here.  Maybe this is 
due to the smoke in the air.

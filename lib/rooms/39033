Underground Den~
  As you step into an unusual section of the cavern the eddies and the currents
have almost all but subsided.  You notice a strange rustling comming from a 
thick patch of reeds along the northern wall.  You get an eerie feeling that you
are disturbing whomever resides in this alcove.

Officer's Quarters~
    The desks in this room are in even worse shape than in the quarters the
east. Not only have the drawers been taken out and splintered, but the desks
themselves are mostly overturned and broken. Needless to say, all the mirrors
that rested on the desks are shattered, and in most cases the frames that held
them are in pieces as well. Someone has wreaked a lot of destruction here, for
reasons that pose a mystery. The only exit is to the east.

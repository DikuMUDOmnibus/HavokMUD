Gritha Factory~
	Here a large steam engine pumps away.  A massive iron mold in the
shape of a gritha stamps down every few seconds producing a fresh new gritha.
The creature grabs a number and asks another next to him,"Who's gonna kill you
today?"  Others line up to be express delivered to the battleground to be
hacked up yet again.

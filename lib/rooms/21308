Great Hall~
    There are a lot of long, flat tables and benches here, lending credence to your
initial guess that this room served as the dining hall for the people of this fortress.
This room is quite large, and the roof is higher than most of the other parts of the
fortress.  It's hard to say for sure, but it looks like the great hall continues on to
the west.  There is also an opening in the south wall, and one in the east wall that
looks like it leads back to the hallway.

Pine Grove~
	You stand in the midst of a clear pine grove.  Most of the trees that
grow around you are rather young.  A thick mat of grass grows at your feet
and several huge rocks litter the ground here covered with a thick coat of
emerald green moss.  A patch of grass has been stained red with blood.  A
small trail leaves north.

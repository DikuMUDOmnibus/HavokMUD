This is a well sized chamber where the prince works on affairs of state and
seeks increased knowledge. The walls are oak lined, and have the heads of
some of the princes trophies. There is a large oak desk here.

The desk looks to be in good condidtion. Lying on the desk are a few books,
some of which look unused. The more time worn of the books seem to be related
to hunting and nature studies.

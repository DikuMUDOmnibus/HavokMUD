Battlefield~
    Corpses litter the ground.  It seems that a band of knights made
their last stand here.  The grass is sticky with blood and a multitude of
vultures soar above waiting to land and pick the corpses clean.  The dark,
twisted trees loom over the bloody scene like quiet spectators.  A path
wanders deep into the forest to the south and another small trail goes
north into a pine grove.

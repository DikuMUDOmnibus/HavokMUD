Plagued Trail~
   The mist is not so thick here.  Small forest animals lay scattered
about you.  All dead from some vile disease.  The flies here are thick as they
feast on the dead and dying.  The tree trunks around you all drip with a
thick slime.  A path leaves south and another trail escapes this place of
death to the east.

animals~
Squirrels, birds, opossums, and even a wolf all lay dead here.  Flies swarm
about their bodies.

tree trees~
Their twisted trunks drip with a yellow slime.  I would not suggest touching
it!

slime~
It seem to me a living parasite of some sort, eating the trees.

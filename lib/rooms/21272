Ancient Road~
    Long ago, this road must have been a thoroughfare, as it is easily forty
feet across. The stones that form it are still in very good shape here, as the
elements have not been able to abuse it here as they have where it is exposed
to the open sky. There is a massive gate set in the western wall here, it looks
to be made of a strange, black metal that resists all your efforts to identify
it. There is a heavy metal bolt-lock built into the center of the gate. It
appears to have been here for quite a while. However, despite the passage of
time it shows few signs of aging; apparently it was built to last. The tunnel
of the ancient road continues north and south, as well.

lock gate~
The gate is large and impressive. The lock is large and extremely complex. It
looks like it would be impossible to pick, without a lot of specialized tools,
anyway. The key would have to be an odd-looking piece of equipment.

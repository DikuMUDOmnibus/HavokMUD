Hallway~
    You are in a dark hallway in the mountain defense station.  The walls are smooth,
cut from the solid rock here deep inside the mountain.  The ceiling is high, almost
fifteen feet.  The hallway bends here at a right angle, it now heads to the south and
east.  There are also openings in the north and west wall.  You can't really tell for
sure what the room to the north is used for, but it looks like it might be some kind
of barracks. The chamber to the west is clearly a bath house.

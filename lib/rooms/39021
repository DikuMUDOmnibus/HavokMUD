Further Down the Hallway~
   As you continue further down the hallway you notice the floor creak.  Upon
further inspection you realize that the floor is slowly dropping out from 
underneath you.  Hearing the grinding of gears in the background freezes you
in your place.  You had better move unless you plan to be the victum of someone's
clever ambush.

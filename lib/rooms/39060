The Resting Chambers~
   This is where many adventurers before have come to rest from there
journeys.  The wall is brown with designs in it.  For people have not
just rested here because from the looks of the ground there is blood
all over it.  It is hundreds of years old.  The death of these people did
not come from dragons it came from humans!

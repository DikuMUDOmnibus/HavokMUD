A quiet dwelling in Sietch Tabr ~
  Dry heat draws all of the moisture on your skin to the top as you break out in
an immediate sweat after entering this simple stone room.  The walls of this room
seem to have been carved out of a smaller, natural chamber deep in a cave system.
There is a small glowlamp floating in the center of the room revealing only a
small, but comfortable looking cot, a stone ledge that shows the wear of use as
a place to sit, and a simple chair and table that has some papers on it.
  Once you become accustomed to the shock of the overwhelming heat and dryness,
you catch the scent of an acrid, yet pleasing odor that wafts through the room
on a barely noticible breeze.  You know immediately what this odor is... it is
the scent of death, the fumes of industry, and the smell of an empire...it is the
spice melange...

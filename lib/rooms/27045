East End of the Cemetery~
   The mist is unusually thick here.  You can hardly see.  An old picket
fence blocks off this part of the graveyard but it has long since fallen to
pieces. A few dozen graves sit all about.  Many small holes have been dug
in the ground here.  To the east is the gate out.
   After a moment it occurs to you that the mist is indeed rising
from the ground.

The newer ones seem to be here.  All of them are from the McGreer family.

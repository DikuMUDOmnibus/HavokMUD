Dead End~
   You seem to have reached the end of the hallway.  The light here is dim as
the torches on the wall seem to have been extinguished.  The floor is cluttered
with bones.  In the corner you see a freshly killed corpse, the stench is 
unbearable.  As you turn around you stub your toe on something hard below.

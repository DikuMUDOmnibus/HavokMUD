The Bath~
   As you enter this damp filled room you smell dirty socks and dust mixed with 
soap and heavy perfume. 4 tubs with hot water are standing in each corner of the 
room and a light dressed woman is serving the adventures drinks and beer. The tubs
are made of wood but are sturdy and fairly new.
The lodge can be spotted to the left.

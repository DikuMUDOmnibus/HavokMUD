South Of The Bottom Floor~
   It is now the southern part of the bottom floor.  It is really just like the other rooms
the monks wondering all around mumbling some weird language.  There is one thing
that is funny though it feels like the wall's are listening to the sounds.  The exits are to
the east, north, and west.

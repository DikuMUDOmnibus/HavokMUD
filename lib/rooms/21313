Cell~
    This is a small cell, surrounded by granite walls that look quite solid.
It is quite chilly here, as the stone walls seem to radiate a coldness that
makes you wrap your arms around yourself for warmth. The cell has a bed made
of stone hanging off the east wall, and a very small hole in the southeast
corner for waste disposal. There is a set of iron bars to the west, through
them is the only exit.

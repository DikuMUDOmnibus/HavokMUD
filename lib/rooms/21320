Stairs~
    A stairwell is carved out of the solid rock here. It leads up to the west,
and doubles back to the east above you. There are torch sconces on the walls
of the stairwell, but they are empty, leaving the place unilluminated except
for your light source. It is impossible to tell where the stairs lead to above,
but there is a hallway visible to the east that leads north and south, and
further to the east you can just see and opening in the hallway wall.

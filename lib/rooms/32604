Madrig's Tower.~
   An iron rung ladder dangles from above, where it leads up to
the very top of the tower.
   A heavy iron chair with chains and manacles sits at the very
center of the floor, spattered with dark stains...  A rickety
old wooden table stands against the east wall, upon which sits
braziers full of ashes and coals, knives, whips, picks, and 
various other implements of torture.
   What kind of mage practices TORTURE!?  Rather odd for someone
supposedly working for the noble Black Watch, guarding the entire
Kingdom's northern border!!
   A thin metal circular stairwell leads downwards into darkness.

A Large Hut~
   This hut is made out of wood and is in very bad shape.  There
is a table, chair, furnace, and a chest.  The legend is told that the
chest holds great treasures and the only way to open it is with
the key that the wizard in this room holds.  The wood on the wall
is beginning to rot and fall apart.  The only way out of this hut is
back to the north.

Ancient Road~
    Long ago, this road must have been a thoroughfare, as it is easily forty
feet across. The stones that form it are still in very good shape here, as the
elements have not been able to abuse it here as they have where it is exposed
to the open sky. It's hard to say how far you have come since entering the
southern tunnel, but looking to the north still gives you no sign of an opening
to the other side. The only source of light here is the one you carry. There are
exits to the north, south, and west.

Overgrown Trail~
   This trail looks as if it was once well used.  Now it is overgrown
and choked with weeds.  The branches overhead are choked with spider webs.
You have to hack and push your way to get through the thick brush.  For a
moment you think you have lost the trail altogether and are trailblazing
only to find some hint of cobbles on the ground.  North of here you see a
small clearing, and to the west is a far clearer path.

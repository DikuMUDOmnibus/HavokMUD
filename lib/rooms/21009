An open field~
   You stand on one of the many concentric grassy rings of this
field. In the centre of the field a large unfamiliar tree is
growing surrounded by a ring of earth then a ring of grass and
so on so that a pattern of concentric circles emerges. You
feel a strange power coming from the tree but as you try to
approach it you suddenly feel quite rejected.  The forest 
parts briefly to thenorth, where a trail heads off, and 
Ershteep Road continues from the east to the west.

Crawlway~
	You are down on all fours pulling your way through this crawlway.
Spider cover the stone all around you.  There seems to be no end to them!  
The steep tunnel flattens out and appears to open into larger chamber further 
west.  From the tunnel the strong smell of death rises.  Some light leaks out 
from a hole directly above you.

You cannot see much further into the darkness but the number of spiders and 
the ever-present smell of death tells you that the lair is close.

It looks as if there is quite a bit of thorny scrub above you.

A Muddy Road~
   This trail exists to allow travelers to pass around the ravine
that blocks the North Road just west of here. Leaves and broken
sticks lie all about, and an occasional broken wheel can be seen,
taken up by weeds. The trail extends northward, where it meets up
with the North Road again.

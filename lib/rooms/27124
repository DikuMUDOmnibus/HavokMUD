East Side of the Chasm~
    You stand on the east side of the huge chasm.  The wind howls from
deep within it.  Spanning it is a small, dangerous looking rope brigde.  The
bottom of the chasm can't be seen and your stomach churns as you look down
into it.  A tunnel vanishes into darkness to the east.

#21293
Stables~
    You have entered an area that is used to house the mounts of the cavalry of
this outpost.  The ceiling in this area is considerably higher than in the rest
of the outpost, so high in fact that you can barely see the roof given the light
emitted from your source.  The stables continue to the north and south.

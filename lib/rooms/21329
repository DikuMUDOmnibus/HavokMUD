Duke's Chamber~
    This room is beautifully and tastefully decorated gold and black.  Despite
the passage of time, the gold shine has neither dulled nor faded,  still very vivid
on the walls, floor, and furniture here. The rich gold color goes quite nicely with
the black color of everything else in the room, including the walls and all the
furniture. The black bed and dresser seem to have been untouched by dust, and there
is a large, gold mirror atop the dresser that is, quite amazingly, spotless and
unbroken.  There is an exit through the door to the north.

mirror~
Not your ordinary reflection. You are reflected, but the image in the mirror
is skeletal. Like you, only with no flesh. Rather disconcerting.

bed~
It is a normal bed, except like everything else here it is covered with both
what looks like a layer of baked-on soot and a fair amount of dried blood.
Somebody here sure bled a lot.

Soldier's Tent~
   This is a stained canvas tent.  The canvas is worn and has take a great deal of
abuse.  Several patches have been added to repair the holes caused by fire-arrows
and age.  The tent contains bedrolls, lanterns, backpacks, and a table.  All the
comforts of home with none of the privacy.

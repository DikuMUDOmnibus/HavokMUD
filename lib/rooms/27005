The Glade~
  This glade is wide open to the sky above.  The waist high grass around you
and the fallen logs have a dull gray tint to them.  Even they sky above seems to
be gray.  Darkenwood looms around you at the edge of the field hiding unknown
horrors.  The forest to the north and east is choked with a thick fog.
Further east a large stone mountain looms covered with dense forest.  Southeast
of here you see a thin column of smoke rising from the foothills.  The path
you are on continues north and south.

The path runs to the north edge of the glade and then dissapears into the
dense forest.

The trail stops at a small bald spot south of here.  There seems to be a 
pile of bones there.

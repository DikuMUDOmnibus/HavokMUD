Devastated Throne Room~
	This once might have been a throne room.  But now it is in ruin.  The
walls have tumbled down and now it is clogged with rubble.  A makeshift
throne has been made from stones, skulls and pelts, but it looks more like a
pile of stones, skulls and pelts than a throne.  An archway leads north and
some rubble has been cleared opening a passage to the west.

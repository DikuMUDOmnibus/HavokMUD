Extravagant Chambers~
    Wow! This room is a stark contrast to everything else you've seen in this
place. There are unmarred furnishings here, complete with expensive tapestries
on the walls, a large, comfortable-looking bed, a desk, and a cabinet filled
with all kinds of interesting stuff. There is a pentagram pattern in the
middle of the incredibly beautiful rug that covers the floor, upon which there
is a small pedestal, which is sometimes occupied. The place shows signs of
recent use. The mahogany door to the west is the sole exit.

pentagram~
You know, the kind used for summoning and controlling demons. It's impossible
to tell if it's actually been used for that purpose, but the neatness of the
room ensures whatever demons might have been summoned certainly must have been
well behaved (and thus doubtless controlled).

tapestries~
Very tastefully done motifs showing the rise and fall of various civilizations.
You think at least one of them may be depicting future events, as you can see
a scene in which a town that has an uncanny resemblance to Shadowdale is being
assaulted by a force of undead. It is quite disconcerting, but the living seem
to at least be holding their own in the scenes revealed there.

pedestal~
A small piece of furniture constructed of a strange organic material you do
not recognize. It is rigid, yet flexible when force is exerted on it. Upon
closer examination you realize it isn't resting on the rug, but hovers a half-
inch above it. Even so, it resists all efforts to budge it. Quite unsettling.

rug~
It is an expensive piece of work. The material is smooth to the touch, yet
very strong. The weave is intricate, almost hypnotizing. It is done
predominantly in black and gold, though the pentagram in the center, upon
which the pedestal rests, is done in a silvery-red.

bed~
The bed is a heavy wooden frame upon which rests an unnaturally comfortable
mattress. The comforter seems to be made of some kind of funny material which
is both soft and yet durable. The sheets are  done in a tasteful off-white
color.

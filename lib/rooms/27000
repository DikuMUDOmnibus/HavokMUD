Dark Path~
      The trail winds east and west here through the gloomy forest.  Large
trees block your view of the sky, their twisted trunks almost crying out
to you.  The smell of death is thick in the air making your stomach churn.
You are surrounded by the unceasing buzz of small insects. This is, without a
doubt, the path to Darkenwood, so named since that day when Heceta, the demon,
claimed it as her own.  Since then few have dared to enter forest to face her
or her coven.

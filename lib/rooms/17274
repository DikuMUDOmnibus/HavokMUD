Queen's Sitting Parlor~
Many tables and chairs fill this room.  There are many distinguished people
waiting in here.  They are discussing many important topics, such as the
Queen's business for the day, new economic programs for the citizens, the 
threat of invaders to the throne.  So involved in their discussions are they
that they do not notice your appearance.

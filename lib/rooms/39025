Turn in the Flaming Hallway~
   You reach a turn in the flaming hallway.  A large pile of bones litters the
floor in front of you.  Stepping on one you notice it cracks quite easily.  
Whatever lies ahead has clearly not been fed in recent history.  You had better
hope that you are not the next meal.

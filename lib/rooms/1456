Cow Pasture~
   The pasture is rather mucky and disgusting.  The field has obviously been over
populated with cows and other farm animals... The field has been eaten away and is
slowly corroding.  Cow dung also inhabits the ground every three feet.  A fence to
the south and west confines the barnyard animals to this field.

oven clay~
Well, it radiates a lot of heat, and it appears to be full of half-baked
loaves of bread.  You find these facts surprising.

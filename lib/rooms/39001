Inside The Temple~
   This is the inside of the temple.  The temple is a pyramid from the way
it looks from the inside.  This temple looks like it has many treasures 
and secrets in it.  This room looks like there is a secret in it for there is branches
covering all of the floors.  There are exits to north, east, west, and south.

Garbage Dump~
	Someone, or something, has been using this clearing as a refuse heap.
Bones litter the ground and the a cloud of flies dance around the rotting meat
left on them.  Most of the bones appear to have been smashed for their
marrow.  Most appear to be from large animals like cows or horses but there
are many human and elf bones here as well.  A small trail leads further north
into the woods and a huge cave looms to the east.  There also appears to be a
small path that goes south.

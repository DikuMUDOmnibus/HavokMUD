Barracks~
    This room clearly serves as a military barracks, where men (certainly some
kind of humanoid, from the shape of the bunks) would sleep and spend some of
their free time. There are several rows of bunks here, stacked two high for
efficiency. At the foot of each is a locker, most of which hang open, some of
which are twisted and battered - apparently from attempts of would-be looters
many years ago. There are two exits from this room, to the north and east.

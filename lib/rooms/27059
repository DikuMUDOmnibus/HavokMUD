South End of the Oak Grove~
   You stand in a dark, overgrown grove.  Spiders seem to be everywhere!
Their webs fill the branches of the trees.  Small bones and pieces of chitin
lay scattered in the grass.  A large, rusted gate stands just to the south of
you.  Oak trees and thick brush grow wild all around.  An old stone path
leads you north to a circle of standing stones.

A circle of huge stones rest just to the north.  Each stone is rough and
rectangular standing about 18 feet tall.

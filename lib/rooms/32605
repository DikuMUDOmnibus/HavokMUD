Madrig's Stairwell.~
   A thick metal railing runs around the outside of the stairwell,
hopefully strong enough to keep you aboard the stairs if you mis-
step!  A faint light from above does nothing to light the dark
stairway, only giving a sense of.. up...  As the stairs continue
down, the darkness gets only thicker.  Another hatch blocks your
travel downwards into the bowels of Madrig's Tower.

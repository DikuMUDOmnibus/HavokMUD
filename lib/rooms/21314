Entrance to Large Cell~
    This is a large cell, surrounded by granite walls that look quite solid.
This room would be quite cold if not for the tapesties hang on the walls to
ward off the chill. There is a small wooden table and 2 sturdy wooden chairs,
all are soundly made and bolted to the floor to prevent them from breaking and
being used as weapons.  There is a curtain hung to the south to give some privacy
to whomever might be sleeping in there.

chair~
A sturdy looking wooden chair. It doesn't look like it'd be worth taking.

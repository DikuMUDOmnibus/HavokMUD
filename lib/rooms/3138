The Mayor's Office~
   You are in the not very big office of the Mayor of Karsinya.  A large and
polished but completely empty desk is standing in front of an armchair that
looks so comfortable that it most of all resembles a bed with the head end
raised slightly.

chair armchair~
This chair is really a masterpiece.  A chair where one can sit as comfortably
as in a bed.  All auditoriums should be equipped with these things.  A shame
that there wouldn't be room for the students too, though.

desk~
This desk is obviously very old.  Nevertheless it looks as if has never been
used.

Practice Yard~
    This half of the practice yard must have been used for more advanced
training than in the yard to the east.  That would be your guess, anyway,
because you can't really tell how the stuff in here operates well enough to
assess what it was used for. There is one contraption with several pieces of
wire tied at varying heights between two tall, flexible wooden poles. There is
also an area where the floor is covered by a strange flexible material, which
deforms and sinks when you put weight on it. Plus, there's a large, flat piece
of wood with several holes drilled in various places all over it. Other, even
stranger devices make you scratch your head in wonder. The practice yard
continues to the east, which is the only exit.

board holes~
A person standing on one side of the board would have to react quite quicky
to projectiles coming through the holes from the other side. Perhaps that
is what it was used for.

flexible material~
It makes you feel very strange to stand on it, since it deforms underneath
you. It might be good for practicing fighting on very unsure ground.

contraption~
It's a curious looking thing, but you have no idea how it worked.

Barracks~
    This room clearly serves as a military barracks, where men (certainly some kind
of humanoid, from the shape of the bunks) would sleep and spend some of their free
time.  There are several rows of bunks here, stacked two high for efficiency.  Some
of the wooden frames of the bunks in this room have been broken.  At the foot of each
bunkset is a locker, similarly broken.  The barracks continue to the south, and you
can also leave through an opening in the east wall, which leads to a corridor.

bunks lockers~
The bunks and lockers look they were chewed up, swallowed, partially digested,
and vomited back up. There's very little left of them.

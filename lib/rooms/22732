A Short Hallway~
   The hardwood floors end here.  The floor is now covered with a
plush red carpet.  The walls are decorated with portraits of
the original leaders of The Order.  A magical orb provides ample
illumination.  The the east the armory can be seen, and to the
west is a small adventurers store.

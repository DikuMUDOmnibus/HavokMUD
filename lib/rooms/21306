Recreation Room~
    The people of this place apparently know how to have a good time, as well
as to drill and fight.  This rec room has a pool table, two dartboards, and a
couple of chess and checker boards sitting on the tables.  Best of all, there
is a bar in the back, which looks like it still has some bottles.

pool~
There are six pockets on a long, flat table covered with a strange fuzzy
material. It is covered by a thin layer of dust. There are no signs of any
balls or cues.

dart darts~
You could use it as a shield if it had some kind of handle. But unfortunately,
neither does it have a handle, nor does it look like it would survive much
damage, as it is constructed out of a pliable material. You can't find any
darts for it.

chess checker boards board table~
The chess and checker boards are glued right down on the tables. You notice
there are stains on them - looks like very old beer stains.

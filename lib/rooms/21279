The Gatehouse~
    This area served as a checkpoint for those entering the outpost from the
outside. There is an extremely large and imposing-looking gate to the east.
In times of old it must have served to guard the outpost from any opposition
forces. It shows no signs of damage, on this side, at least, so perhaps it was
never needed to fulfill that purpose. It has a large, complicated  locking
mechanism, which even the most competent thief would turn green trying to pick.
There is a passage to the west, and the gate stands to the east, leading to
unknown destinations.

lock gate~
The gate is large and impressive. The lock is large and extremely complex. It
looks like it would be impossible to pick, without a lot of specialized tools,
anyway. The key would have to be an odd-looking piece of equipment.

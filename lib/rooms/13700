Gambreezzi's Frozen Food Section~
This room appears to be carved from solid ice.  In fact it reminds you
of a hollow ice cube, except you are standing in the middle of it!
Brrr...sure is cold in here.  Neatly stacked throught this chamber of
ice are row after row of frozen treats.  You can see packages, ranging
from corn and peas to spinach and okra.  Strangely enough, all of the
packages have a funny little label of a BIG GREEN Giant and they read
"Jolly Green Giant".  As you examine the massive stacks of frozen goodies,
you lose control of your appetite, and begin gobbling these tasty 
treats.  Suddenly you hear a deep voice say 'HO HO HO'.  At first you
are startled, but then you relax.  You realize this is the home of the
Jolly Green Giant.  But BEWARE, those muscles and that BIG GREEN club
mean business, so it would be wise no to anger him.

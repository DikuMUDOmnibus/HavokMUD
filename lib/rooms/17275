The Queen's Grand Dinning Room~
This room is nearly empty.  A very long huge dinning table rests in the 
center of this room.  Elegant settings are neatly laid out by the large
kitchen staff.  Delicate tapestries hang on the walls where they may have
been hanging for hundreds of years.  A large emblem of the royal crest is 
printed on the Queen's chair.

Dungeon Entrance~
The air here of pain and death lets you know that you have entered the king'
dungeon. The more you look at the room around you the more you are VERY glad
to be here of your own accord and not under the escort of the king's guards.
Surprisingly there is a warm glow to the north, while the screams of pain to
the west indicate that the torturer chambers lie in that direction.

Hallway~
    This end of the hallway seems particularly dark. There are doors to the
west and south, and both look like they have resisted several attempts to
break into them. The door to the west shows far less damage than the door to
the south.  There is an empty sconce on the east wall.  The hallway also
continues to the north.

mahogany~
There is a warning glyph on it. Apparently this is a private residence.

door~
The door to the south has a strip of a strange yellow substance across it,
upon which is printed some incomprehensible text that has almost entirely
faded away with time. It has multiple dents and scratches, probably from
multiplte attempts to break in over the ages.

   You see a beautifully carved mahogany panel made to reflect the torch light
and brighten this otherwise gloomy hallway.

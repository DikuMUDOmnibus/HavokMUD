Armory~
    This room once served as a repository for weapons and armor for the people
that occupied this outpost.  Though this room has been ransacked, you can still
make out a fair number of weapons of various kinds hanging on the three weapons
racks that occupy the north, south, and east walls.  There are a couple of stands
in the center of the room that look like they were designed to hold armor, but
little of the armor has been left behind.  There is an exit to the west.

They are metallic frames upon which armor could be hung. They are firmly bolted
into the stone floor. No armor hangs on them now.

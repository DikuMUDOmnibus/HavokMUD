Officer's Mess~
    This room served as the dining chamber of the commanders of this place,
and whatever guests they happened to be entertaining. There are four tables
in this mid-sized room, each successively a bit nicer than the one before,
going clockwise from the northeastern most table. There are no settings on
any of them now. There is a doorway to the north, with only swinging doors
separating this room from the kitchen that you can just make out in that
direction. You can also exit to the hallway eastwards.

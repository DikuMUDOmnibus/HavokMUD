Ancient Road~
    Long ago, this road must have been a thoroughfare, as it is easily forty
feet across. The stones that form it are still in very good shape here, as the
elements have not been able to abuse it here as they have where it is exposed
to the open sky. The tunnel has collapsed to the north, and the tons of stones
and rocks that have fallen have completely blocked further passage in that
direction. It is very dark here - your light seems feeble against the pressing
darkness on all sides. You can exit south.

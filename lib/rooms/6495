Stic's War Room~
As you enter the room you see enough equipment to supply a small army. Stacked
around the room are racks and racks of M-16s, SAWs, and other assorted rifles
and heavy weapons. Uniforms and rations are stacked from floor to ceiling in
the corners of the room. Covering every wall are maps of varying countries.
Seated at a long table in the center of the room is a tall uniformed individual,who stands and looks at you wearily, as if pleased at your intrusion to  give
him a reprive from the rigors of waging warfare.

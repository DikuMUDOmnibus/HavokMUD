Bath~
    There are two pits in this room that once served as tubs for the officers
to bathe in. They are both dryed out now, though the channels in the floor
through which the water used to run are still intact. A small hole in the
north wall is the source of the channels in the floor that lead to the two
now-empty pits. A small hole at the bottom of each provides drainage. There
is a single exit, it is to the east.

pit tub pits tubs~
It's about four feet deep and six feet in diameter. It is now empty, but once
water entered through the channels and left through a small hole in the bottom.
These pits were carved from the stone, they were not naturally formed.

outlet drain~
It's pretty small, but by shining your light down it you can tell that it
curves after dropping a foot or so. It was made, it is not natural, just
like the pits themselves.

channel~
They are narrow gutters in the floor of the room through which water flowed
from the inlet hole in the south wall to the tubs. The main one is about three
inches deep, the others are only an inch or two in depth.

hole inlet~
It's right where the floor meets the south wall, near the center. It's only
four inches wide, so you can't really tell where it comes from, though you
can tell it bends up after a few feet.

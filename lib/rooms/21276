Entrance to the fortress~
   The huge archway is made out of rough stone and it seems like it have been under 
heavy boulderfire. A pile of shattered rock lies in the corner and deep holes have been
made on the ground. Here and there are large boulder burried in the dirt. It seems like
the only thing which is still functional is the gate.

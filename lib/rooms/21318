Hallway~
    You are in the south end of a hallway. There is an opening in the west wall,
and it seems to lead into some kind of torture room, though it's hard to tell if it
is occupied from here. There is a strong looking door made of iron bars set in the
eastern wall, with a large metal locking mechanism and handle. The hall also
extends to the north, beyond the range of your light source. There are sconces
on the wall here, but they have no torches in them now. The corridor here, as 
everything in this area, is cut from solid stone.

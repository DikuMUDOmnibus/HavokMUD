Hallway~
    You are in a dark north-south hallway in the mountain defense station.  The
walls are smooth, cut from the solid rock here deep inside the mountain.  The
hallway continues to the south as far as your light will show you, to the north
it looks like it bends to the east. There is an opening in the west wall here, 
through which you just make out what might be a rec room.  There are more openings
further north along the corridor, but your light can't penetrate the inky darkness
from here.

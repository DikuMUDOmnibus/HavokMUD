Bottom of the Underground Cavern~
   The rustling noises heard earlier are now loader than ever.  They seems to be
comming from the north but the extreme darkness prevents you from being certain.
The current continues to the east as it begins to pick up speed.  You had better 
find your way out soon if you want to prevent hypothermia.

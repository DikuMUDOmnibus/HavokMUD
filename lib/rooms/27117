#27117
Long Hall~
     The smell of death is strong here, rising up from the west.  This
long stone hallway recently underwent a collapse.  Much of the rubble has
been cleared out, but it is still difficult climbing over some of the remaining
trash.  What is left of the passage runs weast and west.

Death's Workbench~
	Death sits here at his bench busily working.  On occasion he will
reach into a spar parts barrel grabbing a bone or a rotting member and try
to attach it to his pile of bones muttering ".. damn unions.."  After a few 
minuets a new member of the living dead sits up and grins.  Death gives him a 
hardy slap on that back and says,"Off you go, little one," and sends the 
creation slipping down the express chute to Darkenwood.

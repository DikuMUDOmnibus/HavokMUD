Bramble Path~
	You are on a small foot path wandering north and south.  Tall
brambles grow on both sides of you.  Something seems to be drawing you north.
It is some sort of drive that you cant put a finger on... something...
something evil is drawing you north.

Just to the north you see a huge oak tree growing at the end of the stone
path.  It is silent and still... waiting.

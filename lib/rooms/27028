Inside the Old Cottage~
	The cottage has been devastated.  The tables are broken.  The bed has
rotted into an unrecognizable heap.  The cabinets are open and their contents
spilled all over the floor.  The floorboards creak under your every step.
Mice scurry for cover.  A small ladder on the east wall leads to the roof
and a broken door leads outside.

The mist swirls above you as you peer up to see the widows walk.  You aren't
sure but you think you heard footsteps.

It is an old, iron ladder leading up to a hatch.

hatch~
Warn with age, it might have posed a problem to open at some point but is now
barely holding its own weight.

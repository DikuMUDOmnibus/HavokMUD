Halls of Glistening Azurite.~
      This hall is completely embedded with Azurite Stones, making
it glisten and glimmer with deep blue light, reflecting any light
source into millions of scintellating flashes of color.  All the
colors are rather blinding, and the dampness of the corridor does
not help, traction being at a minimum, and getting turned around
is certainly NOT difficult here...

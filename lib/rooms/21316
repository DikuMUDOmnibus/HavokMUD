Hallway~
    This is the north end of a hallway. The hall leads south as far as your
light source will show you. The stone here is obviously cut - this is no
natural passage but the work of some intellegent species. Given the size and
orthagonality of the doorways and dimensions of the passages, you estimate
that they were probably humanoid. There is wide cell door made of iron bars
set into the east wall, in addition to the route to the south along the hallway.
Peeking through the strong bars reveals the room to be a cell for prisoners,
though from here in the hall it is hard to tell who they might hold. There are
sconces on the walls for torches, but there are none in them now.

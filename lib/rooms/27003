Fork in the Trail~
    Here the dark trail forks.  The main trail runs north-south and a
small branch goes east.  The underbrush here is made up of old, dead thorn
bushes stopping any ideas of trailblazing.  The sky is blocked out by the
twisted branches above.  You feel as though you are being watched.

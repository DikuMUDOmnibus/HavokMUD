4) Kill stealing is illegal.  If you walk into a room that has a person and a
mob in it, ask that person first if this is their mob.  If a mob looks out of
place, like the beholder out of the temple of Old Thalos, do a whozone and
see if the mob is being attacked by someone else before you attack it.
However, there is no mob "reserving".  If you are planning on killing a mob
you must do so within two minutes, you cannot just sit there reserving a
mob for your group for 15 minutes.
 
5) Casting harmful spells on other PC's is illegal.  This includes things
like faerie fire, hypnosis, or feeblemind.  Also using charmed mobs to attack
other PC's is illegal.  Such acts are very childish and not becoming of a
good mudder.
 
6) Looting players corpses is illegal.  If you must get stuff from the corpse
of the person make SURE you have the permission of that person first.  Then,
and only then, can you get the stuff.  If there is an item in the corpse that
you really want and you think that this person isn't on to ask for the item
then you may get the item once the corpse has dissolved, then ONLY!

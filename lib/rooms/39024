Ambush~
   Before you can even realize what is going on the floor gives way and you
find yourself amongst a pack of demon thieves.  By the looks of things they
have not been fed in a few days.  The glint from their daggers dances upon the
ceiling.  You have no choice but to fight them off.  Better watch your back!

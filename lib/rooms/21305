Bath~
    This room serves as a bath house for the soldiers of this fortress.   There
are six open pits in the stone floor, each around four feet deep and six or so
feet diameter, that served as tubs for those trying to rid themselves of dirt.
There are small channels cut into the floor, an offshoot from the main channel,
which extends from a small hole in the south wall, leads up each of the six
pits.  Because all the tubs are currently dry, you can see that at the bottom
of each pit there is a small opening as well.  Ostensibly, water flowed through
the channels, into the tubs, and drained out through the holes.  The engineering
of this room impresses you immensely. There is only one exit, to the east.

hole inlet~
It's right where the floor meets the south wall, near the center. It's only
four inches wide, so you can't really tell where it comes from, though you
can tell it bends up after a few feet.

E
channel~
They are narrow gutters in the floor of the room through which water flowed
from the inlet hole in the south wall to the tubs. The main one is about three
inches deep, the others are only an inch or two in depth.

outlet drain~
It's pretty small, but by shining your light down it you can tell that it
curves after dropping a foot or so. It was made, it is not natural, just
like the pits themselves.

pit tub pits tubs~
It's about four feet deep and six feet in diameter. It is now empty, but once
water entered through the channels and left through a small hole in the bottom.
These pits were carved from the stone, they were not naturally formed.

Hopes Illuminated Palace~
   A paladin smiles mockingly passing his hand before your eyes. The room
vanishes and you find yourself suspended in an other-worldly dimension.
Before you are six strange protals floating at wierd angle and linked to
bizarre pathways. As you watch, the portals change their position but
retain their shape. As you become more accustomed to this strange dimension
you realize that the portals are geometric shapes: you can see a circle
a heptagon, a hexagon, a pentagon, a square and a triangle. In the centre
hangs a glowing form, surrounded by a sphere of energy. Within a heartbeat
the sphere of energy vanishes and the ever so vigilant God of Paladins
illuminated in gold plate armor appears.

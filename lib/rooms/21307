Stairs~
    The stairs lead both up and down from here - this place is bigger than you
thought!  Given what you have seen so far, you have come to the conclusion that
at one time it served as some kind of military post.  From the cut of the stone
and the size of the place, you'd guess whoever made it was humanoid.  Who made
it, and who they were defending themselves against, remains a mystery.  You can
go up or down the stairs, or exit on this level to the east.

West Side Of a Great Chasm~
	You are in a huge cavern with no sign of a ceiling.  Before you is a
huge chasm spanning the length of this cave.  A powerful wind blows from its
depths whistling by you.  A small, rickety, rope bridge spans the chasm,
swinging back and forth in the strong wind.

Hovering above the rope bridge you can see a dark figure waiting for you.

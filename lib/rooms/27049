Dark Forest Path~
	The path is rather wide here, enough for two people to walk abreast.
The dark trees loom above you blotting out the sky.  Large fungi grow on  
the trees all about.  Thick mosses and lichens hang from the branches.  The 
sounds of battle echo through the forest from the north east.

The path continues far to the west... a thick mist hangs in the air.

Hallway~
    You are in a dark hallway in the mountain defense station.  The walls are
smooth, cut from the solid rock here deep inside the mountain.  The ceiling is
high, almost fifteen feet.  There is an opening in the south wall, through which
your light source illuminates a corridor.  The passage to the east leads to the
front gate.

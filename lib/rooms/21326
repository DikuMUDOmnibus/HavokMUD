Hallway~
   This is the northern end of a short hallway. There are sconces on the wall
for torches, but evidently no torches have blazed here for a long time. There
are openings in the walls to the east and west, and the the rather long corridor
continues to the south. The bare stone of the walls is here covered up with a
thin layer of some kind of wood, which has the effect of making the place look
less austere than elsewhere. A small stone is somehow looking wrongly placed.

Cluster of Oaks~
	You stand in a cluster of tall oaks.  These proud trees have been
encased in the misty webbing of these spiders.  The trunks are sticky with
web resin and small baby spiders falling out of the branches keep landing on
you.  A high stone wall runs to the south and east of you as it seems you are
in the corner of an old... garden?  To the west is the gate.  To the north
west you can make out a circle of stones and a small field is to the west.

Conference Room~
    The walls in this mid sized room are covered with faded drawings that are
practically incomprehensible due to the lightness of the lines with which they
were drawn. There is a huge oval table in the center of the chamber, leaving
a relatively scant amount of space between the table and the walls in which to
move about the room. The table is made of a wood-like substance, but unlike the
wall maps it shows no signs of the passage of time. There are fifteen or so
large chairs set around the table, at which the commanders at one time perched
to mull over their battle plans. The only exit is to the west.

table~
It has weathered time's passage extremely well. It is so large, though, that
you have to wonder how it possibly could have been put in this chamber, in
which it barely fits. Clearly the engineers of this place were privy to
knowledge you're not familiar with.

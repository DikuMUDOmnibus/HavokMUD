Misty Path~
	The mist is rather thin here.  It hugs the branches of the limbs
high above you.  The east west path is rather wet here.  To the east you hear
the sounds of battle.. sword against sword.  Just to the north is the form
a huge tree just barely viable through the mist.

You would have to push your way through the brush to get a better look.

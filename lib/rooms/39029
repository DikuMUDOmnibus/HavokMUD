Lair of the Fiery Dragon Lord~
   You have entered the lair of the Fiery Dragon Lord.  Now, even the floor has
become flame.  Before you stands an unfathomably intense mass of heat.  You
feel faint but your adrenaline keeps you conscious.  The Fiery Dragon Lord
chuckles silently to himself as he gives you a look that seems to say I'm sorry
but I'll have to kill you now.

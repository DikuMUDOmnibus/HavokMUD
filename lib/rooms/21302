Hallway~
    You are in a dark hallway in the mountain defense station.  The walls are
smooth, cut from the solid rock here deep inside the mountain.  The ceiling is
high, almost fifteen feet.  The hallway bends here at a right angle it now heads
to the north and east.  Through the opening in the west wall the ovens and stoves
of a kitchen are visible.  Through the opening to the south you see what certainly
must have been a practice yard.

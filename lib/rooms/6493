The Inner Sanctum of Sarc and Alun~
You are lured in by the soft music in the background.  As you look around, you
notice that the entire room is filled with candle lights and your eyes dance
along with the steady flicker of the flames.  A warm fireplace has situated
itself along one side of the wall.  The center of the floor is covered by a
generous area of fur rug.  A bottle of the best Chardonnay rests along in the
ice bucket with the two glasses.  This seems to be a very private and special
hideaway for someone.

Twas like thunder -- all through the night
And a promise to see Jesus in the morning light
Love say, 'Take my hand it'll be alright..come on save your soul tonight.'
Love -- nobody know just how it was born
Love -- came to me with the radio on
Jumped up in my body with an attitude
Kissed me on the mouth and said, 'You leader take me to.'
Love's kiss was running all though my veins
The bed started shaking, I don't know who to blame
Me or this flower right in front of my eyes
Is this my sweet savior or the devil in disguise?

Hallway~
    You are in a dark hallway in the mountain defense station.  The walls are
smooth, cut from the solid rock here deep inside the mountain.  The ceiling is
high, almost fifteen feet.  The hallway heads four ways, it heads to the north,
east, south, and west.  The hall continues to the north.  To the east, you can
see racks and hooks for armaments, some of which still hold equipment.  To the
south and west you see the bunks and cabinets that indicate a barracks.

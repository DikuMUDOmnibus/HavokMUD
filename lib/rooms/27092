Top of Tower Azaran~
    The wind howls around you as you are pelted by small drops of rain.
The thick mist whips and swirls about.  A large bell hangs above you ringing
in the wind.  The roof above has almost collapsed and the walls around you 
no longer stand higher than piles of rubble.  Far below you can see the dark
lake.

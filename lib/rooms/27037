A Porch~
	You stand on a porch in front of the cottage.  The walls are a plastered
white.  The roof is made of thick thatch.  The unceasing sound of someone
hammering metal rises from within the cottage.  The doorway opens just to the
east.  North of here is a small vegetable garden.  To the south is a clearing.

It was hand crafted many years ago.  Its design is simple and effective.
Through the window you can see a fire.

Bend in the Trail~
    The mud in the trail is several inches deep, slowing you progress
greatly.  There is the constant patter of water falling from the unseen
branches far overhead.  To the north the path seems to open into a field.
The path continues to the east.

The path opens into a large clearing.  You see the remains of a white, picket
fence through the mist.

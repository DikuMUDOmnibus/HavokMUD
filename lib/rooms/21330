Kitchen~
    This room is a bit warmer than any of the other places you've visited
around here. The few degrees rise in temperature is a welcome change from the
coolness of most of the rooms here in a place that sunlight never reaches.
There is a stove, and what looks like a pantry, with an old, rusted-looking
lock that is still, curiously enough, intact. You can exit to the mess hall
southwards.

metal plate~
It looks like it was attached to the wall very securely, though what exactly
was used to do so is unclear. With leverage, though, you might be able to pry
it off to reveal whatever's behind it.

stove~
The stove isn't actually working, but it looks like the source of heat is
a large metal plate fastened to the wall behind the stove, which is noticeably
warmer against your hand than the ambient temperature of the room.

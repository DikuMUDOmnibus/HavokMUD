Path Through a Garden~

   You stand on a path in the center of a vegetable garden.  It looks recently
planted as nothing is yet growing.  Just east of here is a well and to the
south sits a small cottage with a wisp of smoke rising from the chimney.  North
of here rises a green hill toward the dark forest.

Barracks~
    This room clearly serves as a military barracks, where men (certainly some
kind of humanoid, from the shape of the bunks) would sleep and spend some of their
free time.  There are several rows of bunks here, stacked two high for efficiency.
At the foot of each is a locker, most of which hang open thoroughly looted.  This
room has a lived-in look, and from the unidentifyable tracks along the floor, the
occupant was here rather recently.  The barracks continue to the north and south.
There is also an opening in the west wall leading out into the corridor.

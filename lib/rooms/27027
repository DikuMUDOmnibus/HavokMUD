Cottage in the Mist~
	You stand in front of an old cottage that has fallen into decay.  The
walls sag and many of the planks have broken free and dangle from the outside
of the building.  The ancient thatched roof is filled with holes and above
that, almost lost in the mist is the rusted shape of a widows walk.  The path
leaves the yard to the west.  To the east the peeling door hangs by one hinge.

The inside of the cottage seems to be quite a mess!

A small field in front of the house opens up beyond the peeling fence.

Once a place of joy, this cottage has fallen into despair and misery.  No
longer a place for the living but a place for the dead.

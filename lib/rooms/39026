Lair of the Flaming Dragons~
   Before you stands two masses of flames, barely recognizable as dragons.  A
large pile of bones stacked to the ceiling lie on either side of the two 
predators.  The flaming dragons take a look at you, then at each other.  Then
both turn and flash you the biggest grin you have ever seen.  I wonder what
that means?

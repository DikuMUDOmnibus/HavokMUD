Hallway~
    You are in a dark north-south hallway in the mountain defense station.  The
walls are smooth, cut from the solid rock here deep inside the mountain.  The
ceiling is high, almost fifteen feet.  The hall continues north and south as far
as your light can show you.  There is also an opening to the west, through which
you can see a set of stairs.

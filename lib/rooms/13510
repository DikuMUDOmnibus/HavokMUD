Donation Room~
This room is new to the temple, it was created during the hard times that
had struct the city in recent decades.  Luckily for them the sultan had
been hoarding some of the basic neccesities for just such an occasion.
These days the donation room depends on the generosity of wealthy 
adventures, and a curse on any that walk in to get all.

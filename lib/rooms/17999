Euphrates Chamber~
You are in a comfortable chamber.  A fireplace glows brightly on the south 
wall, lighting up the entire room.  Above the fireplace is a grand painting 
of the god Euphrates, he is in battle with the forces of good, using his 
magic to destroy all.  In the corner near the fire a huge multi-chromatic 
dragon with many heads is sleeping.  Across from the fireplace is a huge 
throne made of pure diamonds, it sparkles in the firelight.  The floor is 
covered with a red lush carpet and the walls with many tapestries.  Euphrates 
seems to enjoy a higher class of living.

The Bottom Floor~
   This looks like it is considered the middle of the bottom floor or more less where
someone can enter the second floor.  There is a tiny rope ladder hanging from the ceiling
where someone  can climb up.  It looks pretty sturdy from here.  The monks look a
little stronger on the second floor.  The exits are east, west, north, south, and up.

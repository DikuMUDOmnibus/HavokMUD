Barracks~
    This room clearly serves as a military barracks, where men (certainly some
kind of humanoid, from the shape of the bunks) would sleep and spend some of
of their free time.  There are several rows of bunks here, stacked two high for
efficiency. All of the lockers here hang open, silent testimony to the persistance
of some thieves.  The barracks continue to the north, there is also an opening in
the west leading to a hall.

lockers~
They look as if they were battered open rather than pryed. They are all empty.

Guest's Quarters~
    The door to this room looks a bit battered, but at least it's still on its
hinges and capable of closing. The room is sparsely furnished, though it looks
like at one time it might have been rather nicely decorated. What is left of
the furniture in here is pretty much destroyed. What once might have been a
bed is now just a lot of broken wood and torn cloth scattered around the floor.
The dresser is in slightly better shape, at least you can still recognize how
the pieces once fit together. Everything is here is looking pretty broken. The
exit is east.

cloth~
The material is light, but seems to have resisted the trials of time. Once it
was the bed stuffing, is your best guess.

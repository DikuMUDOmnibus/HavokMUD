Liet's Arena~
   A large fighting area lies at the center of this room.  It is covered with
fine sand and allows for plenty of room for moving about in a fight.  Along the
walls are weapons racks holding all varities of hand-to-hand combat utilities.
   At the north of the room there are some chairs that observers can use while
watching the battles.  The only exit is to the west.

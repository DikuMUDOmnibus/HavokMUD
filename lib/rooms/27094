Tight Squeeze~
	You squeeze your way between two large redwoods.  The trail is almost
nonexistent here.  Just a bit further north you can see a clearing and to the
south the trail gets even more overgrown.  The plant life here seems unusually
lush and green.  Large ferns grow around you and you can hear birds singing
in the trees.

The clear looks like it is used as someone's rubbish heap.

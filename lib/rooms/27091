Summoning Chamber~
	This room is almost completely intact.  Old, warped book cases lean
against the walls.  Scattered on the floor are numerous books with their 
pages spilling out.  A pentagram has been drawn on the floor with an
extinguished candle at each point.  A small stairway leads up and another
crumbing one leads down.

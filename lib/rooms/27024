Old Path~
	The path is very dark and a thick mist constricts your vision.  A mat
of moss below your feet seems to cover an old cobblestone path.  Now, after
years of misuse little remains but broken stones most buried just below the
thick mat of moss and leaves at your feet.  Many ferns grow here, some taller
than a full grown man.  The path runs east and west.

It appears that a small, man-made path ran through here maybe ten years ago.

Mustering Square~
    This is the largest artificially created area you've seen down here underneath
the mountain.  It is a assembling grounds for the troops getting ready to go out
to battle.  As you hold your light aloft, you can barely see the roof where a large,
broken sphere once provided light to the grounds.  There is a wide opening to the
west, and narrower tunnels lead to the north and south.  From here it is impossible
to tell where any of these exits lead.

sphere~
It looks like a big empty glass sphere. It is far above you, anchored to the
ceiling by a large chain. There is a big crack in it, and a couple of places
where the glass is broken to reveal a hole in the sphere.

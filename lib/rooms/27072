Muddy Path~
	You are slogging through almost a foot of mud making progress very
very slow.  You stand in a cluster of dead trees with their twisted branches 
breaking as you push your way through the dark trail.  A trail runs south and
north in the gloom.  Further north a thundering chorus of frogs fills the 
air.  Nearby, you think you hear laughing...

You can see the edge of a misty lake just to the north.

It looks like might be a small clearing just through the brush.

Practice Yard~
    This room served as the training grounds the troops used to fine tune
their skills in battle.  All of the usual equipment is here, including the
wooden counterswinger, complete with a worthless battered-looking metal
shield in one hand and a wooden club in the other.  There are also several
humanoid-shaped pieces of cloth filled with hay they are probably practice
dummies.  Plus an indented pit in the center of the room where trainees 
could improve their skill at fighting on uneven ground.  The yard continues
to the west, to the north there is an exit to the hallway.

counterswinger~
It looks like when the shield is hit, it pivots to simulate a blow from the
opponent. It was used to practice dodging and parrying counter-blows.

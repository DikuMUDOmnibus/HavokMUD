Trail in Pine Grove~
   Strong pine trees stand all around you.  They seem healthy and strong.
Much of the brush has been torn up and a small tree broken in twain.  It looks
as if a fight took place here and someone or something fled through the trees
to the south leaving a trail of blood.  To the north you see a battlefield.

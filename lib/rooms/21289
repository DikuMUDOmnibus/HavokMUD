Barracks~
   This room clearly serves as a military barracks, where men (certainly some
kind of humanoid, from the shape of the bunks) sleep and spend some of their
free time.  There are several rows of bunks here, stacked two high for efficiency.
At the foot of each is a locker, all of which hang open, most of which are
twisted and battered, apparently the attempts at looting have been successful.
Whoever cleaned out whatever was in these lockers looks to have spent a great
deal of time in this area, not a single locker remains unopened.  You can leave
east and west to other parts of the barracks, or north to a hallway.

lockers~
The lockers here are in pretty bad shape. Whoever got into them worked them
over pretty good in order to do so.

bunks~
The bunks are undamaged, but don't look like they've been used in the past
few centuries.

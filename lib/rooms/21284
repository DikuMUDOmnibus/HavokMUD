Hallway~
    You are in a dark hallway in the mountain defense station.  The walls are
smooth, cut from the solid rock here deep inside the mountain.  The ceiling is
high, almost fifteen feet.  The hallway bends here at a right angles.  There is
opening in the east wall, through which you can see the bunks and lockers of
soldiers. You can also go to the south and west, where the corridor continues
as far as your light can show you.

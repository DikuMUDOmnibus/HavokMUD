Inside the Hovel~
	You have to watch your step as you walk into this small cabin as the
floorboards are rotting and already sport many holes to the dark waters
below you.  A small wooden table rests here with a dented plate and other
filthy eating utensils.  A large piece of drift wood hanging on the wall
reads 'Home Sweet Home.'  A lantern hanging from the ceiling illuminates the
building.

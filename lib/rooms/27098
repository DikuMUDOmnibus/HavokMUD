High Domed Room~
   The ceiling here is almost 40 feet above you.  Flickering torchlight
dances on the stone walls.  Carved in relief on the stone wall is the icon of
a huge man wrestling with a mighty dragon.  The carving is old and worn with
age.  An high archway exits to the east and a rough stone tunnel leads east.
To the south is a large stone door.  The stone here is old and worn.  These
halls must be hundreds of years old.

Torture Chamber~
    This room has an unpleasant odor, as if something crawled into it an died.
There are dusty, dry webs all over the stone walls, ceiling, floor, and torture
equipment.  You also note there is a recently deceased solder's body still loosely
attached to a set of chains suspended from the ceiling.  From the amount of torture
you'd guess the solder didnt give up any of his secrets easily.

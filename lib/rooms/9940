Bruenor's Chamber~
   This is Bruenor's bedroom.  Considering he is a king, the place
is barely furnished.  A large, comfortable but not extravagant bed
rests against the east wall.  A table cluttered with papers and quill
pens and an ink well stands in the southwest corner.  Shoved beneath
the bed is a large iron chest with personal items, and an intricately
carved washbasin stands near the exit to the north.  An armoire with
plain cotton clothing sets along the west wall, and beside that is a
wooden stand holding an extra suit of dwarven armor.
   Through a small hole in the floor, access can be gained to the
entrance chamber for the guild hall of The Order.

On the Dark Path~
	You move onwards.  Torches burn on the sides of the path.  Skulls line
your way.  You break through a thin wall of webbing and move onward.  Your 
stomach is knotting up.  Sweat drips off your brow.  Just to the north you 
can make out a small misty clearing filled with figures. The hags are so close 
A dark chanting grows louder and louder.  This place REEKS with evil.  Shadows 
laugh and dance about you, taunting you to go further north.

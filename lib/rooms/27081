Near A Hovel~
	Jutting out of the water on stilts is a small building that is nearly
over.  There is a large hole in the roof and light streams out of the window.
A small, rotting dingy floats out front.  Clashing with the eerie howls in the
dark a jovial chorus of banjo playing rises from within.

You can only hear the jovial music inside the cottage.

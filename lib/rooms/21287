Hallway~
    You are in a dark north-south hallway in the mountain defense station.  The
walls are smooth, cut from the solid rock here deep inside the mountain.  The
ceiling is high, almost fifteen feet.  The hallway opens up to the north into
a large area, to the south the hallway continues on.  There is an opening in
the east wall to a room full of long, flat beds with tables and cabinets next
to them.  From the faint light cast off them from here by your source of
illumination, you can't tell for sure what purpose they served.

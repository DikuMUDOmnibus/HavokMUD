#27044
West End of Cemetery~
   A few dozen grave stones lay scattered about.  The grass here is
very tall but has been trampled on a lot recently.  The mist seems to rise
from the ground here.  The feeling of evil is so overpowering that you are
having to fight hard to keep from vomiting.  The one tree that grew here
is sickly twisted and very, very dead.  More stones lie to the east and
the gate out is just to the west.

It looks as if someone has been digging up the graves.

They seem quite old.  It appears that every McGreer who died in the past
hundred years is buried here.

Bend in the road~
   Once this part of the land was nothing more than a grassy wasteland.  But now
just large wheelmarks of something are seen.  Perhaps the wheelmarks are that of
a large catapult.  Almost no grass tho is left and its very clear that serval horses
and troopers have traveled this way.  Dented helms and shields and human bones every
once in a while can be seen.

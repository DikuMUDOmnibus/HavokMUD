Dark Shore~
    You are on the south edge of a small lake.  The waters are as black
as night and a thick mist hangs over the water.  From all around you, you
can hear the croaking of frogs lifting into the sky like an inhuman chorus.
For a moment the fog clears and you can make out a small island out in the
mist.  Then as quickly as it happened the fog swallows up the island again.

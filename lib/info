HavokMud Info

Havok is a magical fantasy world where roleplaying and having fun 
are at their best. Our mud is going on 8 years of up time and have
plans to be around for much longer. Havok is based on DaleMUD, a 
codebase modeled after Dungeons and Dragons rules. It features 
multiclassing capabilites and an overwhelming array of traditional
spells, Classes, and Races. The mud is bound to be a challenge for
old experienced mud players and good for new players, first starting
off. For more information on Havok and its administration, check out

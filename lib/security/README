This directory contains the security listings.   each 58+ level god must
have a file in this directory, with their name. the file should consist of
an internet address, in whatever format the game prints out the result of
the 'user' command.    for example:  "doldrums.cis.ufl.edu", or 
128.227.224.35

most of the time, it will be a string address. on some busted machine types
it will be a numeric address.   only one site per god currently, but the
limitation can be as general as '128'

the sample file contains an example listing.  the god 'sample' would only
be allowed to log in from the machine with the ip address 128.227.224.35

if your machine handled ip->name conversion correctly, you could use
doldrums.cis.ufl.edu 
instead of the numeric address.

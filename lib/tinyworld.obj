item, yet who would not be tempted. This suit seems to emantate an
aura of power, yet, at the same time, intense grief and pain. Such is the
life of a Warder....

further still, you see the great form of Tiamat howling
with eternal rage.  The visions stop and rest upon a vast
open plain, devoid of anything except for grasses.  Sitting
in the middle of the plain is a single solitary figure, robed
in white. He stands up and looks at you..
-
'Hello my friends, I am Gabriel, Guardian of Souls. I welcome
you to this, my soul... rest well and be forever protected.'
-
He gently kisses each of you on the forehead and the visions
return. Suddenly, your gaze is snapped back from the statuette,
and you can't help but feel relaxed at the visions you viewed
and the blessing of Gabriel on your soul.

sword~
   The hilt of the sword is fashioned out of the small ivory balls
found in the hearts of a Tarrasque.  It took nearly 500 years to
collect enough of the ivory and grind it down into the proper 
material to make the hilt. The top part of the hilt extends about
two feet to either side of the blade.  Each end is capped with a
glowing ruby, and each is lined with quicksilver that seems to 
continuously flow in a non-ending circle. 
   The blade of the sword is truly magnificient. It is fashioned
out of a perfect piece of crystal, harvested from the skies 
themselves. For each star that was gathered, another piece of
the crystal grew.  After many many eons, the crystal was fashioned
into the finest blade in all the lands.

This oddly colored book was obviously written by a druid (that probably would

One thing that does catch your eye is a chapter about telling which trees are
able to cast spells. Apparently, Eucalyptus trees and the trees that "shiver"
do not cast spells, but the trees that "moan" do.

Chapter 2, verses 9-21
And St. Antioch raised the hand grenade up on high saying 'Oh, Lord,
bless this thy hand grenade, that with it thou may blow thy enemies to
tiny bits in thy mercy.'. And the Lord did grin, and the people did
feast upon the lambs and sloths and carps and anchovies and orangutangs
and breakfast cereals and fruit bats......

And the Lord spake saying 'First thou shall take out the holy pin,
then shall thou count to three, no more, no less. Three shall be
the number thou shall count, and the number of the counting shall be
three. Four shall thou not count, neither shall thou count two, excepting
that thou then proceed to three. Five is right out. Once the number three,
being the third number, be reached, then lobbeth thou thy holy hand
grenade of Antioch towards thy foe, who, being naughty in my sight,
shall snuff it.'

sword~
   This sword emanates such an intense aura of goodness, that it
warms the most evil of hearts. The pommel of the sword is crafted
out of a thick shaft of ivory and shaped into a pair of angel wings.
The ivory contains many runes and markings to ward away evil 
spirits.
   The blade is a magnificent piece of work.  It was forged deep
in the hearts of the mountains, where the most skilled of the
dwarven weaponsmiths worked for years to just properly collect
and cure the metal needed for the weapon.  The blade is crystal
clear, almost translucent.  In the middle of the blade is a single
eye that seems to watch the lifeforce of it's wielder.

staff~
   The staff is made out of polished ivory, cultivated from the
lushest jungle in all the lands.  It had to be carefully cured
and polished for a year before it could be enchanted.  The way
a Staff of Angels is created is very unique, as such, only gods
usually have the power necessary to create such an item.  The
souls of the mortals have power beyond belief, power that rivals
that of even the gods (yet the mortals themselves cannot 
wield it).  The souls of departed mortals who served so well in 
mortal life are graced with the ability to have their soul
binded to the Staff of Angels.  With this done, mortals
are able to harness the power of the human soul, thus
resurrecting others whose time should not have come so
soon or suddenly....

angel-figurine-guardian~
The figurine is so beautiful, it makes all who gaze upon it awe
at it's beauty. It is carved out of a small piece of ivory,
which was collected from deep in the Jungle of Chult. The 
figurine stands no more than 8 inches tall. The wings, however,
span out about 1 and a half feet it would seem. The wings
are greatly detailed as each feather is carved with amazing
grace. The lines between the feathers are lined with liquid
gold that magically flows back and forth creating a spectacular
effect. The face of the figurine is quite noticeable, it is
carved in the image of the Goddess of Love and Desire, Alora.
A dress of very thin white silk seems to flow from the figurine.
It is amazing how someone could have carved the ivory so THIN to
make it seem like material. Truly the work of a great artist.

bed~
This bed belongs to the great Goddess of Love and Desire, Alora. It is a
four-posted bed with a fine white silk canopy. The posts are made out of
fine white ivory from far off Mordilnia. They are intricately carved and 
detailed by the finest artistans of the land. The posts have carvings 
detailing great noble dragons flying in the sky with their noble human 
escorts. The bed itself has sheets of silken gold, woven from the thin silk
produced by the spiders in the Underdark. The headboard of the bed is not
made out of any mortal material, yet it contains the VERY essence of the Plane 
of Fire as it is ablaze with an eternal fury. The canopy is made out of a white
silk sheet, so thin and fine it is hardly noticeable. Specks of gold are 
scattered throughout the sheet. At times, if one looks close enough, the gold
specks come together and form a great gold dragon which flies across the canopy
guarding the person sleeping in the bed.....

It has a very hard clear material through which you can see the contents.
Efforts to break through it are unfruitful. You wonder where the troglodytes
could have discovered such an item. There is a small hole on the left edge of
the case; ostensibly it is the locking mechanism.

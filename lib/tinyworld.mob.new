the Elven Wizard~
An Elven Wizard is here, creating fireworks for the festivities.
~
The Elven Wizard looks at you in a solemn sort of way.  His gaze seems
penetrate through your innermost being.  He is wearing a silvery cloak
and holding a multi-colored staff.  Although he appears to be older
than the oldest man, he seems to have an inner strength which most mortals
cannot overcome.

ring keeper~
the Keeper of the Ring~
The Keeper of the Ring is here, guarding his treasure jealously.
~
The Ring Keeper is a rather big but short halfling.  His short stature and
bulbous nose belie his true nature.  An elven sword that glows with a blue
light hangs from his belt, and on his finger you see the One Ring.  Although
usually a halfling of peace, he will fight you to the death if you attempt
to take away that which belongs to him.

notices your intense scrutiny, he looks at you coldly, until you are
forced to look away.

incomprehensible language. On its top, a small eye cluster swivels back 
and forth continually.  A number of tentacles are juggling a dizzying
blur of objects.

The Warren Guard~
A Warren Guard stands here, grinning evilly.
~
As you peer intently at the Warren Guard it sneers at you, revealing
rotting yellow teeth.  The guard is dressed in a motley assortment of
armor, none of which looks like it's doing much good.  Fortunately, for
it, it appears to be very quick, and very strong.  As you approach it
brandishes it's glaive and mumbles something about dinner arriving.

killing lots of things.  Hey, wait a minute, maybe that is his axe
sticking out of the wall.  Do you think he would get mad if you 
took it?

one west of town.  Every once in a while he gathers up a bunch of
adventurers to go hunt this cursed down, but the dragon never 
fails to return at a later time.  The rest of the time it looks

Much to your surprise you are standing on dusty clifftop overlooking
a magnificent ocean.  The sun seems to be frozen just over the horizon,
turning the ocean into a swirling plain of gold and black reflections.
A warm and gentle breeze brushes your face.  You hear the roar of the
waves crashing rhythmically on the rocks below, interspersed with cries
of seagulls floating lazily overhead.
     To the north you can see a large city by the ocean side, far larger
than Shadowdale, perhaps far larger than any city you've seen before.  It
seems to extend infinitely to the north.  From this distance the city
resembles a spectacular field of colorful lights, twinkling before you
in silent majesty.

You can't see much here but the echo tells you that there's quite a drop
down. You can just make out a huge dark pool out there in the darkness,
mostly because of the trickling of water. The water from the sewer
actually
washes over this ledge and makes it quite slippery. From here it drops,
like a waterfall, into the pool far down.

somewhere ahead, and to the north you see a narrow wooden bridge.  The
scents of perpetual spring either delight or disgust you, depending on
whether you go for the trite stuff like this.

Over the years, litter and debris has built up in here from the prey of
the crawlers. All sorts of bones, human and otherwise, are heaped and piled
here and there. A large sinkhole in the middle of the cave has acquired some
water from somewhere and you see a strange glow coming from the bottom of the
hole.

You are sailing on a huge ocean that extends in many directions.  Due to
the changing winds you cannot always go the direction you choose.  You

     You are at the main room of the Wild Wereboar Tavern, the place is
a total mess.  You can tell this place is accustomed to many brawls, the many

well as the Aborigine Stronghold to the distant South-West, the Roo Fortress
to the South, and the Eucalyptus River flowing between them towards a Lake.

    This is a twisty underground tunnel with many exits and entrances.
The ground is more or less even, but the passage walls are so similar in
kind that it is impossible to differentiate one passage from another by them.
There are exits leading in all four compass directions. The tunnel floor
has been worn smooth by the passage of many feet.

beneath the drawbridge on which you now stand. You can't see any farther
than the inside of the entrance, for the castle appears to be totally
without light.

positioned in the center of the walkway.  Large apple and orange trees line
the sides of the building as you look at it, giving you a sense of peaceful
splendor.
   The fresh-cut lawn and exotic flowers show you that the owner of this
place has much wealth.
   Northward, through the marble support columns, is a large double door.

Main street heads towards the market eastward and the wilderness beckons
from the west. To the south lies the entrance the warriors guild.

He appears to be a demi-god, though why he has decided to gossip the
latest news for Karsinya is beyond you (as are MOST Immortal doings,
of course!).  A powerful aura about him makes it quite clear that he
is immune to any earthly attacks of mortals - definately DON'T mess
with the Gossiper!  He carries in his hands many reams of the latest
news tidbits from throughout the Worlds, and obviously uses his Psi
powers to good use in this position.

Mesolian is a friendly old elf. A pair of gold-rimmed glasses sits on
his nose, and a pencil peeps out from behind his pointy elven ear. The
years have been kind to him, and he seems in a good condition. As the
caretaker of the tower, he's made studying old tomes a way to whittle
away the time that remains to him.

Melodia Merqueen~
Melodia~
The Merqueen sits on her throne, wondering which human male to seduce next.~
Melodia has reigned the Lagoon for years and years on end now. Her goals
are obscure to those that come from the breathing world, and can only
be guessed at. One thing is sure though.. she hasn't managed to produce
an heir. Lately she's become rather frantic about the issue, seducing
many a human. The stories go she doesn't even check their gender any
longer, just pouncing on them the first chance she gets.

Lancelot~
Sir Lancelot du Lac~
Standing here is Lancelot du Lac, the greatest among mortal men.
~
He looks like he has been fighting all of his life, and has yet to lose.
The courage in his cold, gray eyes is unmistakable.  Enormous muscles
bulge on his arms, and his chest appears slightly larger than the last
wine barrel you saw.  Having this man for an enemy is about the worst 
mistake one might make.

bulbous nose belie his true nature.  An elven sword that glows with a blue
light hangs from his belt, and on his finger you see the One Ring.  Although
usually a halfling of peace, he will fight you to the death if you attempt
to take away that which belongs to him.

The snake charmer~
The snake charmer sits here blowing his flute.
~
     The snake charmer is a small brown-skinned man.  He is wearing only
a loincloth and head wrap.  His body is covered in sparkling beads of
sweat, but you can't tell whether that's from the fierce rays of the sun
or from his concentration on his playing.
~
A simple but haunting melody floats from the snake charmer's flute.
~
You hear faint strains of music drifting on the wind.

Golgar, the mighty god of the troglodytes, prepares to smite you.
~
This lordly figure is like a troglodyte, only on a larger scale. He must be
twenty feet tall, and as such barely fits inside the caves of his believers.
Golgar wears no armor and holds no weapon - his skin looks like it is carved
from solid granite, and his heavy fists area easily larger than the head of
any humanoid. You feel a tremendous urge to grovel in supplication before him,
but this is slightly weaker than your urge to run in terror.

Valik~
A wizened mage paces quietly here, waiting for the end of time.
~
The robes he wears are old and worn, and his pointy hat droops a bit as he
walks to and fro, intently staring with unfocused eyes at a point somewhere
on the infinite horizon. When his attention flicks by you, a strong feeling
of guilt washes over you and fades, like everything must in the passage of
time. You suddenly recall a phrase you've heard somewhere:

    "Do not meddle in the affairs of wizards, for they are subtle,
     and quick to anger."
~
Reality flows and shifts, then refocuses about the wizened mage.
~
You hear the whispering of the wind, and think of times gone by.

female soul has more compassion and understanding for others thus
making them the best guardians for the eternal souls that reside
within the City proper....

The Demi-Lich leaps from his throne as you enter the room, his evil
eyes fixed dead upon you!
~
The Demi-Lich is, perhaps, the single most powerful undead creature known
to exist.  Greatly resembling a wight or mummy, and being gaunt and skeletal
in form. It is, nevertheless a being of foreboding might. Its eye sockets
are black and empty, save for the fierce pinpoints of light which serve as
eyes. An aura of cold and darkness radiates from it, which makes it an 
ominous and fearsome sight. Despite the wasted, rotten flesh it is garbed
in the rich clothes of nobility.

A writhing, quivering mass of horrific, unspeakable flesh-like material, this
ancient one stares coldly about through its many multifacted eyes.
viscous, vile smelling liquid seeps through its flesh in many places,
originating from the ghastly, crater like pores which pepper his body.
Disgustingly, large portions of its flesh seem to bubble with an alien
life of their own. The surface of its body, where not oozing, is covered
with mottled, grey, mossy protrusions, like some strange malignant
blemishes. It emits low, guttural mewlings from its fanged, quivering
orifice.

An Ethereal Post~
A tall misty rune-encrypted post floats here in the nothingness.~
   Through the misty post you see what must be the Central Bazaar
of Tarantis, though none of the usual crowd is visible, and the
normally bright colorful atmosphere there seems quite dulled.
Local militia and Tarantian Soldiers are seen, proudly displaying
the black and white colors of Tarantis.

The Great Northern Keep.
   Through the ethereal post is seen what appears to be the Great
Northern Keep.  It's walls stand very tall and are covered with
a serene blanket of cool white snow.  It's northern gates are
locked, indicating possible trouble from the evil hordes to
the north of the keep.

Karsinya's Market Square.
   A peculiar looking statue stands in the middle of this square,
as does a large, healthy looking cherry tree.  Judging by the livery
of the guards and pages wandering about, this post must lead to the
Market Square of Karsinya!

Fire and Ice the Two-Headed Dragon~
Fire and Ice roars a challenge with both it's Red and White head!~
Fire and Ice is.. or once was at least.. an immense Dragon of
ungodly size and might.  In death he is now but a shadow of his
former self, but still is enough to make most adventurers quiver
in their boots.  2 immense heads jut from the skeletal corpse,
one with flame and smoke drifting about it and the other with
steam from frozen ice wafting around it.

   Chadkranther is a hill giant of bigger than normal size, with
muscles rippling across his broad chest and arms.  He is, how-
ever, dead...  his eye sockets would be empty but for the evil
red glow emanating from within, and the muscles appear to be 
stretched across the large bones with no skin to cover them...

Destarte~
Destarte is here, her origins unknown to all.~
Destarte simply is.  You are unable to determine a race of
class for her, she simply.. exists!  A blobous form, with many
protrusions that could be limbs, eye stalks, sensors... who
knows!  She is massive, and seems to have a VERY bad temperament,
judging by the look in her eyes (are those eyes!?) and the many
gaping maws full of sharp teeth (and those are DEFINATELY teeth!).
Umm..  is that ACID dripping from those toothy maws!?!?!?

average build and weight, brown hair, brown eyes, a normal nose,
and even relatively normal dress.  His clothes are all white,
which is wierd considering where he works...  Despite all the
normal looking things about him, he DOES look like he could
whoop some booty if someone were to piss him off...

It takes but a moment to realise he is also BUTT naked, but
for a cone dangling between his legs.

The Undead General Wargrave~
The Undead General Wargrave's corpse lies within it's sarcophgus.~
   The undead General Wargrave was once a large and powerfull man.
He is now a sallow wasted version of his prior self - probably
because he is DEAD.  His bones are draped with crumbling clothing
of a once rich nature, and his armor no longer gleams with it's
polished brightness.  His eyes, however, gleam with a light most
unholy, and an evil laughter can be heard faintly from within
his dead carapace.

black ivory claws or teeth send shivers down even the heartiest
of souls, and the whispery breath of this creature can cause
a mighty warrior's heart to stop beating.

dark magic, or may have originated on another plane of existence.  Regardless, 
it is rearing itself up before you resembling a huge, eyeless beast with wicked 
teeth and long tendrils that it uses to grab and paralyze its pray before swallowing
them whole.  Perhaps now would be a good time to run...

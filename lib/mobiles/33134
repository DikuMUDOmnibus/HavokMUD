Nathchim~
Nathchim takes his cue from Ainsbrith and draws his shortsword.~
Nathchim wears a cowled cloak like most thieves tend to, this
one a myriad of dark colors that seem to swirl in such a way it
hurts to look at.  His short sword comes quickly out of the
belt sheathe in which he keeps it, and his eyes glint with a
mischievously evil light.

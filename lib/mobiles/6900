the computer bug~
A little, hairy computer bug is here, trying to mess things up.
~
It is one of those irritating little creatures that like to infect innocent
and defenseless programs, trying to make them act weird.  Programmers spend
countless hours trying to eliminate them, but they are indeed very hardy.
DikuMUD is known to be one of their favorite habitats.

Aurum vorax~
The huge aurum vorax~
The huge aurum vorax stands here, bloody gore oozing from its maw.  ~
This enormous creature looks something like a giant badger, only 
it has eight legs, each ending with razor sharp claws, and a mouth
full of teeth large enough to saw a man's arm off in one quick bite.

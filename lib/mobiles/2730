A color pool~
A dusty green color pool can be seen as you approach.
~
    From this height, you can see the Eucalyptus Forest around you as
well as the Aborigine Stronghold to the distant South-West, the Roo Fortress
to the South, and the Eucalyptus River flowing between them towards a Lake.
    It looks like you can make it down the steep Western and Northern 
side from the top but not back up from the bottom.

Prince Roo-Preckt~
Prince Roo-Preckt runs around the room banging pots and pans.
~
His mind is obviously gone! He wears an eye-patch over one eye, has
a fork with a cork covering the tines in his belt, and carries a
pot in one hand and a pan in the other which he constantly bangs as
he runs around the room.
~
Roo-Preckt yells out, "Oklahoma! Oklahoma! Oklahoma!..."
~
You hear some muffled shouting and banging nearby. (combat?)

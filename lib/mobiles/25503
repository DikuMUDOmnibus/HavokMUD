The Fire Giant King~
The Fire Giant King is here resting in a large oak chair
~
   This is a very large obese creature, lines of many years of
frustration and pain mark his aged skin. He wears a long cloak
that covers most of his large frame, but you notice a huge great-
sword hanging from a jeweled scabbard at his side.

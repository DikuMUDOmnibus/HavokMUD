The Caravan Master~
The Caravan Master is here, looking over various trade documents and maps.
~
     The caravan master is clothed in a white robe trimmed with gold and
he wears on his head a turban holding a sparkling red gem.  Despite his
rich clothing, he appears quite fit and strong, and the large two-handed
scimitar at his feet shows the signs of hard use.

A Black Naga Guardian~
The Black Naga Guardian is coiled here.~

The guardian naga is a serpentlike creature, coal-black scales
shield an elongate body with the head of a woman, and make no sound
with her curious writhing. It looks intelligent enough to judge
whether you are worthy to pass into the guild of rogues that is
its keeping.

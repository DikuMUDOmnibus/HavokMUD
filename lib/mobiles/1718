the Grand Master of Monks~
You see a human casually chopping up a few logs with.... HIS HANDS!
~
   He calmly looks you over with a very impassive face. You also realize
that this guy could easily rip you apart with his bare hands from the way
that he can chop those logs. He also carries around a pouch with the money
of the monastery (after all, can you think of a safer place?).

Wylie Baker~
Wylie Baker, lord of thieves, is here plotting to rob the world blind.
~
Wylie is quite the nasty individual. He is wanted by Thar Theron for crimes
against the kingdom, dead or alive. At his choice you can see that it will
have to be the first of the two. As you stare at him longer you begin to
notice his striking resemblance to an old friend of yours!

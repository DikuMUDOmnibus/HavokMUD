A statue of Auril Frostmaiden~
A statue of Auril Frostmaiden, Demipower of Pandemonium, stands here.~
The statue is carved from simple stone, but is of incredible
worksman.  Auril Frostmaiden's features are intense, and the
statue seems almost to drip with water from the ice on the
statue's frostaxe.

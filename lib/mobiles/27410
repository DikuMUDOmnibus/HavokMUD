The Roo Prisoner~
A beaten up Roo Prisoner looks at you with a blank stare.
~
You can tell this Roo must have put up a fight from all of the small cuts
and bruises on him. Unfortunately, his will is broken and it doesn't
look like he could put up a fight like he used to....
~
The Roo Prisoner pleads you to spare his life.
~
You hear moaning from nearby.

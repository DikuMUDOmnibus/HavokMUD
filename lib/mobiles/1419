The Cow~
A hard-eyed cow is here, going about his business.
~
He is walking around purposefully, as if searching for something,
occasionally lowering his head, sniffing at the air, then eating
pieces of the ground that are apparently somewhat grassy.  When he
notices your intense scrutiny, he looks at you coldly, until you are
forced to look away.

the Snake-God~
The Snake-God sits atop his uncomfortable throne awaiting your arrival.~
The snake god is shaped like a man, but it's skin is covered with
serpent scales, glistening wet.  The head of a snake sits atop
the frame, albeit human sized, and an intelligent gleam in the
eyes of this one ensure you that he is not to be taken for
granted.

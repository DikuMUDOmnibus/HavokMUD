Gymme~
The armory shopkeeper is here tending her forge.~
Gymme is the twin sister of Bob the weapons shopkeeper, (She must have
gotten all the looks in the family). Unlike her brother, Gymme prefers
to use her skills crafting armor. Sweat drips off of her deeply tanned
skin do to the forges heat and the armor that she insists on wearing at
all times. When you enter she looks up with a scowl, almost seeming to 
say you are much too puny to wear my armor twerp!

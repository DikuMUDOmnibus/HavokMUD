the phantom spirit of the forest~

You have discovered the protector of the Theronian forest. It wonders
about the forest, protecting it from harm. It is not allowed to harm
any living being regardless of it alignment, unless of course it is
attacked. Instead it wanders about cleaning up the forest, so that any
items dropped there can not be used by the vile thieves.

Cur~
Cur, the hill giant chief, screams in rage at your approach.
~
Cur looks young and inexperienced.  He is hardly out of adolescence yet what is
left of the tribe depends on him to rule them.  His left cheek bears the tattoo
of an eye.
~
Cur mutters,'Hecate demands your sacrifice!'
~
A barbaric scream fills the air.

Melodia Merqueen~
Melodia~
The Merqueen sits on her throne, wondering which human male to seduce next.~
Melodia has reigned the Lagoon for years and years on end now. Her goals
are obscure to those that come from the breathing world, and can only
be guessed at. One thing is sure though.. she hasn't managed to produce
an heir. Lately she's become rather frantic about the issue, seducing
many a human. The stories go she doesn't even check their gender any
longer, just pouncing on them the first chance she gets.

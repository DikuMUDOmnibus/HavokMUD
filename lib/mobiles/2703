A githyanki knight~
A bandaged form outfitted in ornate plate mail charges you in the name of
some alien god.
~
  This sickly man sized creature is swathed from head to foot in bandages.
The bandages resemble that of a mummy's, but this creature's are not
as complete.  Pieces are missing here and there, and beneath you glimpse
flesh.  It's eyes glow with a malevolent reddish glow.  It wears
exceptionally well made banded mail and wield a wicked sword.

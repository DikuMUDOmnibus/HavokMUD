Fungoid demon~
Fungoid demon~
A fungoid demon stalks you - it's next meal!~
This ugly demon has a fat, round body, a fungoid head, sharp pointed
tail, spiked horns, a row of razor sharp scales lining it's back, and
sharp clawed hands and feet.  It's skin is mottled grey and covered
with a disgusting fungus.

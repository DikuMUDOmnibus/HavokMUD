Samual Steeljaw~
Samuel Steeljaw is oiling his jaw after a long adventure.
~
Samuel Steeljaw is a tall, semi-muscular half-elf, with a deep tan and
 a strange helmet upon his head. It looks like large steel jaw has
been attached to the helmet. The jaw seems to be very well used. He 
almost reminds you of a garbage disposal.

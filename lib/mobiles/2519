a massive waiter~
The Warrior Guild's waiter is here, merrily washing plates.

Under the waiter's apron there is a definite amount of bulk, all
of it rippling with power.  God only knows why this man works for
a bunch of rats.  He should be out wielding a humongous sword and
killing lots of things.  Hey, wait a minute, maybe that is his axe
sticking out of the wall.  Do you think he would get mad if you 
took it?

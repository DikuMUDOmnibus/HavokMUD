Pooh the Werebear is resting here after a day of werewolf hunting.

     Pooh the famous good-natured werebear is relaxing in his home.  He looks
up at your arrival and says, "Hello there, I hope you didn't have any 
difficulty getting here... those bad little werewolves are always getting the
way.  I would show you a map of the land that I've explored back in my 
adventuring days, but the evil Count Boarish has stolen it from me."

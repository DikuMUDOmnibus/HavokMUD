Queen Hippolyta~
Queen Hippolyta, queen of the amazons, stands here.
~
This fierce warrior is the queen of the amazons.  You can tell that she
earned her position by battle.  Like her sisters she is only armed with
a spear and shield, but her agility is amazing.  Around her waist is a
Jeweled Girdle, which signifies her leadership over the amazon tribe.

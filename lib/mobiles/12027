Zan Orzord~
Zan Orzord quietly teaching all the ways of kindness and oneness with nature.

   Dispite his appearances, Zan is a very powerful cleric, yet he chooses to
use his powers for healing the sick and curing the blind. In a single glance
you can tell that he is a very kind, peaceful man. As he notices you looking
him over, he smiles, nods at you and says, "peace and love my child."

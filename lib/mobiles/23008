Wandering Dark Dwarf~
A wandering dark dwarf~
A wandering dark dwarf looks a bit lost and grumbles about his leader acting strangely.~
This dark dwarf wanders aimlessly about.  He has a look of utter 
confusion on his face.  "Everything was going smooth", he says, "until
our captain hit his head or something.. now he wants war!"

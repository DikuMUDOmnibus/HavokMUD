Stone Snake~
A Stone Snake ~
A Stone Snake drags its huge body, its stone scales scraping noisily. ~
This huge snake of stone has fangs the size of a large halfling,
its eyes glow a malevolent yellow, and it emenates pure evil.
At various parts of its body, it has small hands protruding from
its carapace, and they end in wickedly clawed fingers.

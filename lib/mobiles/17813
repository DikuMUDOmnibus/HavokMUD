A nomad trader~
A nomad trader is here exhibiting his goods and haggling with passerby.
~
     The trader carries his small selection of merchandise with him.
You see him step in the way of passerby and show them his goods,
hoping to interest them enough to get a sale.  More often than not he
is ignored.

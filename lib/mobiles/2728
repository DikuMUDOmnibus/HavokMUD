A color pool~
A dirty brown color pool can be seen as you approach.

     You are at the main room of the Wild Wereboar Tavern, the place is
a total mess.  You can tell this place is accustomed to many brawls, the many
pieces of furniture spread around the room gave you the hint.  There is a old,
creaky, sagging staircase leading upstairs.

the Gelfling Weaponsmaster~
The Gelfling Weaponsmaster is here pounding away at some metal.
~
   He is a very strong Gelfling. His muscles ripple, and he sweats, 
even in this cold environment.
~
The Gelfling Weaponsmaster slams a hammer upon the anvil. Sparks fly.
~
You hear clanking and hammering from somewhere nearby.

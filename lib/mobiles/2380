A groaning spirit~
A groaning spirit is here wailing upon you entry into the room.
~
  This creature is barely visible.  You feel a great need to flee from this
creature.  The wailing it puts out strikes fear right down to your soul.
~
The groaning spirit wails loudly.
~
You hear some pitiful whining nearby, a sound filled with anger and sorrow.

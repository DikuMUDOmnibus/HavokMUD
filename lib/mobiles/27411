The Roo Hunter~
You see a Roo Hunter.... My God! That Roo's got a Gun!
~
A true combat veteran if you ever saw one. It is his job to sneak in behind
enemy lines and ambush the Aborigines and their allies single-handedly.
~
The Roo Hunter says 'You will roo the day you crossed my path!'
~
You hear an evil laugh nearby

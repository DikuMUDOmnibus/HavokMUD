Valik~
A wizened mage paces quietly here, waiting for the end of time.
~
The robes he wears are old and worn, and his pointy hat droops a bit as he
walks to and fro, intently staring with unfocused eyes at a point somewhere
on the infinite horizon. When his attention flicks by you, a strong feeling
of guilt washes over you and fades, like everything must in the passage of
time. You suddenly recall a phrase you've heard somewhere:

    "Do not meddle in the affairs of wizards, for they are subtle,
     and quick to anger."
~
Reality flows and shifts, then refocuses about the wizened mage.
~
You hear the whispering of the wind, and think of times gone by.

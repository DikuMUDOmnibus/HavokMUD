Athos~
Athos the great knight is somberly nursing a bottle of wine.~

Athos wears a face of sorrow on his noble countenance, displaying
only a few quiet words of philosophy when his tongue is loosened
by drink. His dress depicts a man of learning and his voice one
of some foul experience. Something - or someone - still haunts
him to this day.

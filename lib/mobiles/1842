Prince Ulvian~
Prince Ulvian~
Prince Ulvian is here, practicing his swordsmanship.~
The prince looks like he is a fine swordsmaster, the way he holds his blade and himself
just proves it that he will be a formidable opponent. It don't help things to know that he 
has a magical blade, enchanted so it will hit more often either.

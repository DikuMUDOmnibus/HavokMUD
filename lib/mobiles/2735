Entrance To The Lair
   This is the door to the Skexie Lair, meeting place of the Counsel of the
Skexies.  This door has a strange keyhole.  It is heavily clad with straps of
metal and iron bars.  You sense fresh air from both the west and east.  It
is a welcome change to the stale Skexie atmosphere you have been in.

The death knight is here praying at his unholy altar.
~
This is a fallen knight paladin, whom during his life broke his vows and is 
now cursed for his evil actions in life. He is armored in obsidian platemail,
and stands before an altar covered in dried blood and defecation. His eyes
glow with an Erie reddish light and he seems to be drawing his power from the
altar itself.

courier postmaster~
A disgruntled courier~
A disgruntled courier awaits your bidding.~

The grey and strained eyes of the courier look at you with ill-concealed
lack of interest. The scars on his face are an indication that he has
seen foul weather of all sorts on the roads, and nothing you could
request would surprise him.

The lemure~
The lemure blob slithers terribly precisely towards you for an attack!
~
This looks like a vaguely human blob. Big black yellow eyes, and a
mouth going a little bit out from the face. The lemure does not look
interested in you at all, but anyway it attacks. It looks like it's
mind has been burned out.

kestrel giant bird pet~
A Giant Kestrel~
A Giant White Kestrel is perched near its master.~

The kestrel's plumage is pale as lamb's down, making it a beautiful
animal, but the sharp curved beak and arched talons remind you
of its predatory habits. A tiny metal ring is clasped round one
leg.. it must be someone's pet.

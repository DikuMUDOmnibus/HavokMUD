A rusty orange color pool can be seen as you approach.~
In Front of the Villa
   You stand in the front yard of this lavish courtyard.  There is a
beautiful marble fountain of a dragon with water flowing from its mouth,
positioned in the center of the walkway.  Large apple and orange trees line
the sides of the building as you look at it, giving you a sense of peaceful
splendor.
   The fresh-cut lawn and exotic flowers show you that the owner of this
place has much wealth.
   Northward, through the marble support columns, is a large double door.

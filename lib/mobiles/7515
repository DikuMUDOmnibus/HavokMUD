the Giant Battlemaster~
A fierce looking giant, bristling with weapons, is crouched in battle stance.

The scarred old giant stands here, bristling with weapons.  He appears to
be a veteran of a thousand wars.  The mark of many a dwarven axe is upon
him.  He looks a very tough nut to crack.  He looks into your eyes and
says, "you are a cunning mensch to come this far into the castle.  But I
say you not so smart as you think because Now You Die!"

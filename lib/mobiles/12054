alchemist shopkeeper~
the Alchemist~
A strange old man is here pouring different colors of liquids together.
~
The Alchemist makes potions for almost any need.  He looks up at you
as he mixes a potion, only to add a drop to much and cause a minor
explosion.  He chuckles and offers to show you his wares.
~
The Alchemist bumbles a vial and drops it, resulting in a loud explosion.
~
You here a loud explosion and the sound of breaking glass.

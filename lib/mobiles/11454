Milady De Winter~
A beautiful woman with fair hair flares angrily up at your intrusion.~

Milady de Winter is a slender form draped in white ermine and 
knowledgeable in the ways of enchantment. Golden hair falls
to her waist, her eyes are cyan blue and widened with anger,
or perhaps a tinge of fear. Long presumed dead, she wears
one of many guises and is accustomed to discarding lives.

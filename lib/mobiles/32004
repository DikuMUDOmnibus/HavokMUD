An Ethereal Post.~
A tall misty rune-encrypted post floats here in the nothingness.~
   The High Seas.
   Through the misty post you see a small simple dock in the middle
of a huge sea, the waters lapping gently against the wooden posts.
Near the dock to the north the waters get very rough, tossing and
turning with huge waves.  Near the dock to the south, the sea
suddenly drops off the edge of the very world itself!

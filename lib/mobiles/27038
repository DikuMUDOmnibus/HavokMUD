boatman man shadowy~
the boatman~
As mist parts the shadowy form of a boatman comes into view, holding his
lantern aloft.
~
Riding on the skiff is a dark robed man.  He pushes the boat with a long pole
and holds his lantern above him.  For a moment the light passes before his hood
and the skull visage comes into view.

A halfling beauty stares dreamily into your eyes.
~
She is the most beautiful creature you've seen in quite some time.  As you
stare at her, thoughts of all else vanish.  You get the sudden urge to grovel
at her feet, hoping she'll take you in like a lost puppy.  You wouldn't dare
harm a hair on her precious little head.

An Intellect Devourer~
A large brain-like creature trots along here on 4 beastial looking legs.~
This strange looking creature resembles a large brain with a
3 foot tail.  It moves around on 4 beastial looking legs, possibly
like the ones seen on a panther or mountain lion.  The brain itself
secretes an acidic looking substance, which drips down the tail.

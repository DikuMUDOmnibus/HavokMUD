A Lacedon~
A rotted ghoul swims towards you.
~
  This creature looks like a ghoul except that it has been underwater for 
a long time and has been rotting away at a faster pace.  Flaps of green
skin hang loosely from its face and arms.  It sees you and opens its mouth
letting out a soundless cry.

A sharp sleek corsair ship~
A sharp lined quick looking corsair ship hunts the waters of the High Seas here.~
The ship is not large - small enough to be manned by a 4 or 5 man
crew, but it appears to be very quick and dangerous.  Singing can
be heard from aboard.  Entering the ship could be interesting...

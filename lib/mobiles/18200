Emilither paces the room, trying to remember what he's brewing.

Emilither is a stately old Mage, garbed in mouse-colored robes, and the
tattered remnants of a graying beard.  His puzzled expression is that of
undiscovered bewilderment.
~
Emilither says 'Hrm...healing potions require belladonna, no?'

Off in the distance, someone babbles random confusion.

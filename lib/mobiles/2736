A dark crimson color pool can be seen as you approach.~
Inside the West Gate of New Thalos
  Two large stone towers embedded in the wall loom over you. The massive
iron gate, emblazoned with the crest of New Thalos, swings easily on
four ornately crafted hinges. It is obvious the makers of this city
spared no expense in protecting their home.
Main street heads towards the market eastward and the wilderness beckons
from the west. To the south lies the entrance the warriors guild.

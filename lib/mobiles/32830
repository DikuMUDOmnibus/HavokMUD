A statue of Eldath, Demipower of Singing Waters~
A statue of Eldath, Demipower of Singing Waters, stands frozen here.~
The statue is carved from some type of marbel, and is done with
incredible talent.  Eldath's gills are even carved into the side
of his humanoid neck, and his stony eyes almost seem to be staring
at you in anger!

Peg-leg Pete~
An old peg-legged sailor hobbles about serving drinks to the clientele.

Pete looks over at you and nods, indicating he will be with you in a 
moment.  It appears Pete had been swimming in the wrong waters, by
the lack of a right leg.  You assume it was taken by a shark, since
the leg is carved in the shape of a shark.

The Lich, King IceHeart of Winterfell~
King IceHeart of Winterfell rests here in dreamless death.~
The dead king stares back at you with vacant eyes, burning a
hole in your very sole.  His fine regal trappings of royalty have
long ago faded to a shredded withered version of their previous
glory, and his skeletal remains remain intact.

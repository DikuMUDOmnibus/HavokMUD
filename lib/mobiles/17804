An angry nomad~
A nomad stands here, arguing in a loud voice and yelling curses.
~
    The nomad's face is beginning to go purple with rage as he argues
with his companions.  You try to see what caused the gleam that
attracted your eye, but his long robes cover all.
~
The nomad utters an extremely vile curse, and you remember it for later use.
~
You hear a few voices shouting nearby.

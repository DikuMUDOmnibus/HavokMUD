Artemis Entreri~
A lone human seems out of place here in Menzoberanzan~
     Artemus Entreri is the only man alive who can stand toe to toe with Drizzt Do'Urden
in single combat. He is a master assasin who has earned even the respect of to capricious
drow. All of Menzoberanzan's citizens give this powerful warrior a wide berth. Perhaps you
should follow their lead and leave him to his plotting against the Do'Urden rogue.

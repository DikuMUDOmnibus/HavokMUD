Alastair the Skexie Leader~
Alastair the Skexie Leader is here relaxing in an easy chair.
~
   Alastair doesn't take his job too seriously. He is a very large 
robust Skexie. His feathers are red and yellow. His entire appearance
is a bit more professional than that the other Skexies, however.

Alastair the Skexie Leader says, 'Thank You for coming. Good Luck!'

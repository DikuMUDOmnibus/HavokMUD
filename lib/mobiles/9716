A hook horror~
A bipedal hook creature hisses at your arrival
~
 The hook horror looks like a cross between a vulture and a human
having large hooks where his hands would normally be. Large spikes
grow from various points on his body of thick exoskeleton. He stands
about 9 feet tall and weights about 350 pounds.

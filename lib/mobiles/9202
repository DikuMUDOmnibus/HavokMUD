The Hill Giant Chieftess~
The Chieftess of the Hill Giants is standing here.

The largest female you have ever seen stands before you. She has a moose skin
wrapped around her shoulders. You smell the scent of "Eau de Giant" originating
from her. She appears to be heading off to go shopping. A huge stone VISA card
is clenched between her fingers.

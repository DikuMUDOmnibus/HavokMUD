The master mindflayer~
The master mindflayer is here, looking at you with an evil look.
~
It's a seven foot tall humanoid dressed in a purple cloak, and swinging a
black and purple rod above its head as if it was going to attack you any
moment now. In the middle of its head are four tentacles with sharp points.

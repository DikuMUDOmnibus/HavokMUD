the Royal Theronian guard~
A Royal Theronian guard is here protecting the kingdom and Thar.
~
The royal Theronian guard is the highest honor that can be bestown upon a
guard in Theronia. They are the fighting elite of the kingdom, second
only to Fargo, their captain. Better mind your manors around this guy.

Praise Wert, God of Theronia!
~
Hail Thar, lord of all Theronia!

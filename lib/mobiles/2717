A color pool~
A checkered color pool can be seen as you approach.

Much to your surprise you are standing on dusty clifftop overlooking
a magnificent ocean.  The sun seems to be frozen just over the horizon,
turning the ocean into a swirling plain of gold and black reflections.
A warm and gentle breeze brushes your face.  You hear the roar of the
waves crashing rhythmically on the rocks below, interspersed with cries
of seagulls floating lazily overhead.
     To the north you can see a large city by the ocean side, far larger
than Shadowdale, perhaps far larger than any city you've seen before.  It
seems to extend infinitely to the north.  From this distance the city
resembles a spectacular field of colorful lights, twinkling before you
in silent majesty.

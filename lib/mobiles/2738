An icy-white color pool can be seen as you approach, frosty vapors making the air cold.~
Northern Gate of Winterfell.
   A HUGE gate stands open here, leading out north onto the
northern plains.  North Winterfell Street leads off to the
south, headed for the Ether Post of Winterfell and the Worlds
Inn.  To the east and west, NorthGate Road leads to guard
towers cornering the city.

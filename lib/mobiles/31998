A pet pseudodragon flaps about on it's masters shoulder.~
The pseudodragon sports a wingspan of approximately 3 feet total,
and it's many teeth are perhaps 1 inch long at best.  A wicked
intelligence gleams in it's draconic eyes, however, and it's many
colored scales offer some serious protection.

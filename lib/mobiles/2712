mezzodaemon hyrblanok astral_mob~
An insectoid-like mezzodaemon~
A mezzodaemon wanders by, performing an errand for some master.

  This deamon has an horny exo-skeleton.  Every once in a while a black
forked tongue will snake out from it's beak and taste the air, reminding
you of a snake.  It's multi-faceted eyes stare at you and a dozen other
places at once.  Unfortunately, this creature seems more interested in you
than the dozen other places.

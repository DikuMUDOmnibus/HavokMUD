korred dwarf~
a korred~
What looks like a goat-legged dwarf with four foot dread locks, grins at you.
~
This short, bearded thing has shaggy goat legs and a wild unkept beard.
He grins evilly at you and plays out a haunting score on his pan pipes.  
His arms look very strong and he could easily over power even a strong man.

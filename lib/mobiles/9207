Hill Giant Keeper~
The Keeper of the Hill Giants~
A large, hunchbacked Hill Giant is standing here.
~
This hill giant has a large hump over one shoulder. He is missing one eye and
walks with a limp. His scars show him to be a warrior of great age and his arms
show that he still has great strength.

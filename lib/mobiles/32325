Fire and Ice the Two-Headed Dragon~
Fire and Ice roars a challenge with both it's Red and White head!~
Fire and Ice is.. or once was at least.. an immense Dragon of
ungodly size and might.  In death he is now but a shadow of his
former self, but still is enough to make most adventurers quiver
in their boots.  2 immense heads jut from the skeletal corpse,
one with flame and smoke drifting about it and the other with
steam from frozen ice wafting around it.

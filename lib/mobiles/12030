Thar Lord~
Lord Thar Theron~
Thar Theron, Lord of Theronia, is here ruling his people with a kind heart and
a bloodied sword.
~
   Thar is a massive individual dressed in red and black armor. As you look at
his masked face, you wonder who or what could have scared such a powerful man.
The bright, blue eyes that burn beneath his mask, seem troubled, but what 
could possibly worry this Lord of the battlefield. What ever it is, it had 
better have five heads and really bad breath, because Thar looks really upset.

The Wretched Vampire~
The Wretched Vampire~
The Wretched Vampire glides silently towards you.  ~
This vampire was once a handsome man, but has now joined the ranks 
of the undead.  Having once too often indulged in sinful and evil acts,
his soul was captured upon his death and twisted into this creature.
He looks down at you regretfully, as if he did not want to kill you.
He nods at you as a gesture of respect, then attacks!

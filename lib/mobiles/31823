a pilgrim~
A pilgrim wanders here looking for the true Winterfell Gods.~
The pilgrim wears a simple robe, sandals despite the cold, and
has his hood pulled low over his head.  His skin is well tanned
despite the permanent cloud-cover here, and looks wind-chapped
as well.  He obviously travels a lot, and on foot at that!

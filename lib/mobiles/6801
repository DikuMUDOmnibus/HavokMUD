dragon white~
the huge, white dragon~
A huge white dragon is here, its narrow red eyes glowing with rage.
~
This enormous winged serpent has snow white scales covering most of its
colossal body.  Numerous holes in its huge wings tell of many fights as does
the nicks in the horns on its head.  It smells as disgusting as only dragons
do.

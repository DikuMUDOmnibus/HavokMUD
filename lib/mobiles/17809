A palace gate guard~
A Palace Guard stands here watching travelers pass through the gate.

     This man is outfitted in metal armor barely concealed by his
sun-blocking white robe.  He stands casually at his post, but he looks
alert and you have heard that the Pasha's Palace Guard are trained to
fight fiercely to the death.

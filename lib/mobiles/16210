The cave thing~
A small, wretched creature squats here, shaking and muttering
~
It vaguely resembles a halfling, although it is clearly old, and
quite pitiful looking.   It snarls and shivers, truly an unpleasant
sight
~
The cave thing looks at you and moans 'Have you seen my pretties???'
~
You hear a low moan from somewhere nearby

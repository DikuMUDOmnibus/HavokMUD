the Elven Wizard~
An Elven Wizard is here, creating fireworks for the festivities.
~
The Elven Wizard looks at you in a solemn sort of way.  His gaze seems
penetrate through your innermost being.  He is wearing a silvery cloak
and holding a multi-colored staff.  Although he appears to be older
than the oldest man, he seems to have an inner strength which most mortals
cannot overcome.

the Snake-Goddess~
The Snake-Goddess sits atop her uncomfortable throne, flicking her tongue at you.~
The snake goddess is shaped like a human with a snakes head, her
skin coverd with glistening serpent scales.  A chill runs down
your spine as her eyes seem to hypnotize you and a venoumous drip
falls from her mouth and hisses on the floor.

A human slaver is here, appraising his merchandise.
~
This is one of the cold northern men who engage in the flesh trade.  They
are a rich people now, for the Giants pay well for slaves.  This one wears
fine Thalos silk, and perfumes from the distant south.  He flies about
confidently like all of his people but does not look to be a mage himself.

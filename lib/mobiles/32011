An ethereal post~
A tall misty rune-encrypted post floats here in the nothingness.~
The Great Northern Keep.
   Through the ethereal post is seen what appears to be the Great
Northern Keep.  It's walls stand very tall and are covered with
a serene blanket of cool white snow.  It's northern gates are
locked, indicating possible trouble from the evil hordes to
the north of the keep.

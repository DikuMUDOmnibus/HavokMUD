Shilandra, faerie queen, hovers before you.
~
She is beautiful beyond compare.  Luminescence locks of blond hair flow like honey
down her shoulder.  A smile passes across her face as she sees you.  She says,
"If you can rescue one of my daughters from the giants, I will help you find
the hag's grove."

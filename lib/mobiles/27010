hag green greenhag~
the greenhag~
A crooked, old, green hag weaves powerful curses before your very eyes.
~
You shudder looking upon this wretched crone.  She is the result of the demon
called Night Hag rapeing a human male.  Magic flows through this half-demon's
blood.
~
The greenhag weaves a foul curse over you.
~
An evil chant can be heard to the north.

skeleton longdead knight~
The skeleton of a longdead knight~
The skeleton of a longdead knight screams silently and attacks.~
The skeletal remains of this longdead knight moves without a sound,
it's mouth open in a silent scream of agony, it's bony remains
moving at the command of some possibly long gone necromancer.

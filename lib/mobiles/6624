Statue Patron Haag~
The Statue of Haag~
An enormous statue of the patron stands here, and no antipaladin dares
speak its terrible name.
~
Haag is portrayed here in all of his terrible majesty.  Dwarfing his 
giant dogs, the statue scares the sh-- out of all sane people in the
room.  Each of his fists is larger than your head, and he looks like
he could squeeze coal into diamonds.  An angry fire in his eyes echoes
the evil glow of the black amulet about his neck.

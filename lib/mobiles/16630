The Portal guard~
A Portal guard stands here to prevent creatures from leaving the Abyss.
~
A huge burly man stands here.  He tells you "Don't enter, or you will
surely die." He is wearing full plate mail and carries some very nasty
looking weapons.  He says "IF you do enter make sure you have a recall...
You've been warned."

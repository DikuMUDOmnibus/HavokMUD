A githyanki master conjurer, one of the most powerful, ~
This figure glows with an eerie light that seems to be emanating from it's
robe.
~
  This sickly man sized creature is swathed from head to foot in bandages.
The bandages resemble that of a mummy's, but this creature's are not
as complete.  Pieces are missing here and there, and beneath you glimpse
flesh.  It's eyes glow with a malevolent reddish glow.  It wears a robe
that casts a greenish tint to the room.

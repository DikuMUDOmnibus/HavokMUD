The earl of Sundhaven~
The Earl of Sundhaven is out for a stroll.~

A tall noble with sand-colored hair and goatee is strolling by with 
an amiable but authoritave countenance. Long out of knighthood, he 
nevertheless looks quite confident in his abilities to defend himself, 
and has gone on to wining, dining and governing the human population.

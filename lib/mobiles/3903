Mesolian is a friendly old elf. A pair of gold-rimmed glasses sits on
his nose, and a pencil peeps out from behind his pointy elven ear. The
years have been kind to him, and he seems in a good condition. As the
caretaker of the tower, he's made studying old tomes a way to whittle
away the time that remains to him.

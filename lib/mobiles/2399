Hieracosphinx sphinx~
The Hieracosphinx~
The Hieracosphinx rests here.
~
  Looking like a cross between a lion and a man, the Hieracosphinx turns its
eyes on you.  Growling at your approach, flexes its huge muscles and you
notice it has a set of feathery wings on its back.  You'd best be careful
when dealing with this mighy beast.

The Warren Guard~
A Warren Guard stands here, grinning evilly.
~
As you peer intently at the Warren Guard it sneers at you, revealing
rotting yellow teeth.  The guard is dressed in a motley assortment of
armor, none of which looks like it's doing much good.  Fortunately, for
it, it appears to be very quick, and very strong.  As you approach it
brandishes it's glaive and mumbles something about dinner arriving.

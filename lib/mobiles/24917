The guardian of time~
A guardian stands watch here.
~
Here is a figure as old as time itself.  It stands 10 feet and
must weigh over a thousand pounds.  Its cape shimmers and the mace
it has is held clutched to its breast.  Its face shows no signs of
life, but it seems very aware of who passes in front of it.

an angelic guardian~
An angel flies silently in the air here, guarding the city.~
   By some, they are called 'the Guardians'.  The angel guardians
are the sole protectors of the great City of Zoroastrian.  All
guardians are female.  The reason for this is simply that the
female soul has more compassion and understanding for others thus
making them the best guardians for the eternal souls that reside
within the City proper....

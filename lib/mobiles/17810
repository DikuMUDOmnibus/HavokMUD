The snake charmer~
The snake charmer sits here blowing his flute.
~
     The snake charmer is a small brown-skinned man.  He is wearing only
a loincloth and head wrap.  His body is covered in sparkling beads of
sweat, but you can't tell whether that's from the fierce rays of the sun
or from his concentration on his playing.
~
A simple but haunting melody floats from the snake charmer's flute.
~
You hear faint strains of music drifting on the wind.

A camp guard~
A nomad dressed in armor under desert robes watches you.
~
     The nomad camp guard looks relaxed and seems to take no concern
over your presence.  However, despite his casual attitude you can feel
his eyes on you, and you see a glint of steel beneath his robes when the
wind picks up.  You know that the wrong move could cause him to eagerly
fight you to the death.

gar fish~
a humongous lake gar~
A really big fish with lots of sharp teeth has lucked into its next meal.

This fresh water whopper must weigh half a ton. It is shaped like a cigar
tube, and has the same silver coloring. It's fins are small, but its teeth
more than make up for its lack of maneuverability.

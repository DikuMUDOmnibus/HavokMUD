Biff the Dragon Slayer~
Biff the Dragon Slayer is sitting here talking of old times.
~
This weary adventurer is about 40 years old.  He is renowned for
his adventures in dragon hunting, in specific a nasty old green
one west of town.  Every once in a while he gathers up a bunch of
adventurers to go hunt this cursed down, but the dragon never 
fails to return at a later time.  The rest of the time it looks
as if Biff drinks himself into oblivion.

dying man paladin~
the dying man~
A weak and dying man looks at you with pleading eyes.
~
This is one of Kaylor's mighty paladins. He has been beaten and tortured, to 
near death. He speaks to you in a voice so weak you have to get right next to 
him to hear. He says 'the death knight draws his power from the altar, beware 
the evil that lies below...' Then he passes out.

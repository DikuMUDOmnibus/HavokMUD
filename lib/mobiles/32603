A Guard of the Black Watch.~
A Guard of the Black Watch stands sentry here.~
The Black Watch are from all corners of the world, standing a
noble post to protect the northern borders.  Their armor is of
black chain, and they all show the sigil of the Black Watch - a
silver WinterWolf leaping from a black background.

Laurel mage~
Laurel the white mage~
Laurel the white mage smiles broadly at you as she moves about the shop~
Her long dark hair has flowers strewn about on it, making her look quite 
childlike and innocent.  The knowledge of the white ways of magic fill her 
face and eyes, surprising you with a wisdom that was not expected from one 
that looks so young.

Wolfblood~
Wolfblood, the Royal assassin, is here plotting his next covert operation.
~
Wolfblood is a highly skilled assassin who was hired by Thar to get
rid of any unwanted rulers in other lands. You realize this is one guy
better left alone. Was it 1001 or 1002 ways that he could bring you to 
a slow, agonizing death. Wolfblood denies all accusations of being in 
league with the C.I.A.

A wraith~
A dark shadow occupies the alcove.
~
 A dim resemblance to what it once was this shadow of a person
barely seems to be on the same plane as you. Darkness seems to pour
from the wraiths eye sockets.
~
The wraith lets out a low moaning noise that sends shivers down your spine.
~
You hear a low moan, it sends shivers down your spine.

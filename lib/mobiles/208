Agin the Scholar~
Agin the Scholar~
Agin the Scholar sits here pondering the mysteries of the universe.~
A small frail balding man sits here surrounded by many books and
quills. He mutters under his breath about equations he cannot solve
and mysteries that boggle his mind.
~
Agin the Scholar mumbles, "Why DID the chicken cross the road..hmphf!"

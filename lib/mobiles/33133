Bremaerel~
Bremaerel listens quietly to his master, Ainsbrith, sharpening his blade the whole while.~
Bremearel is dressed in the common garb of thieves, a deep dark
hooded cloak, black soft leather boots, black leather gloves,
and many-a-blade stashed about his person.  He winks at you in
a manner not unfriendly, but his evil grin gives him away.

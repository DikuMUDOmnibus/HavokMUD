A Peryton~
A large dark-green eagle with the head of a blue-green antlered stag flies about.~
The Peryton resembles an immense, 5' tall eagle with dark green feathers,
but sports the blue-green head of a stag with obsidian antlers.  It's
eyes glow with a malevolent intelligence, and it does NOT look
happy to see you!

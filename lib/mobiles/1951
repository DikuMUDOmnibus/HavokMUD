flying reptile snake~
A flying snake~
A flying snake swoops about looking for something to eat
~
  This colorful creature is supported by invisibly swift, gossamer wings,
making it resemble a reptilian humming bird. The fangs at it's mouth
however do not give you the impression it will be as nice though.

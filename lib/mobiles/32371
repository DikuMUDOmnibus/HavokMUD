Destarte~
Destarte is here, her origins unknown to all.~
Destarte simply is.  You are unable to determine a race of
class for her, she simply.. exists!  A blobous form, with many
protrusions that could be limbs, eye stalks, sensors... who
knows!  She is massive, and seems to have a VERY bad temperament,
judging by the look in her eyes (are those eyes!?) and the many
gaping maws full of sharp teeth (and those are DEFINATELY teeth!).
Umm..  is that ACID dripping from those toothy maws!?!?!?

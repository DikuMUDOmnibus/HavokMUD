The prisoner~
A prisoner is chained to the wall here
~
Though his clothes are all in rags, you can see that at one time they must
have been fine garments. A metal muzzle has been fitted over the poor 
wretch's mouth, whether to keep him from screaming, or to silence his spell
casting you cannot tell.
He looks quite mad, no doubt he's been mistreated horribly.

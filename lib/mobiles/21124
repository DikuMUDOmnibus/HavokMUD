Golgar, god of the troglodytes~
Golgar, the mighty god of the troglodytes, prepares to smite you.
~
This lordly figure is like a troglodyte, only on a larger scale. He must be
twenty feet tall, and as such barely fits inside the caves of his believers.
Golgar wears no armor and holds no weapon - his skin looks like it is carved
from solid granite, and his heavy fists area easily larger than the head of
any humanoid. You feel a tremendous urge to grovel in supplication before him,
but this is slightly weaker than your urge to run in terror.

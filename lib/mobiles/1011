A shiriff of the Shire looks for signs of trouble.
~
The shiriff is over waist high, quite tall for a halfling.  His eyes are
ever roaming, looking for signs of trouble from riffraff like you.  In
his belt is a thin dagger, and on his body he wears a suit of leather armor.
This is one halfling you don't want to mess with.

Jareth Shadowdaemon~
Jareth Shadowdaemon stands here, his sword humming with thought energy.~
Jareth Shadowdaemon stands before you, a demon crafted of pure shadow.
Jet black, he blends in extremely well with the backdrop of the Library.
He wields a sword that hums powerfully with thought energy...it glints
in the light for an instant as he raises it to point at your heart!

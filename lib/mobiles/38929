Karashka the Rakshasa Maharaja~
Karashka the Rakshasa Maharaja~
Karashka the Rakshasa Maharaja stands here glaring evilly at you.  ~
Karashka is quite tall for a Rakshasa, standing eight feet from 
head to toe.  His body is that of a ferocious bengaled tiger, and
he has two heads.  He is dressed in finery to make even kings and
queens look shoddy.

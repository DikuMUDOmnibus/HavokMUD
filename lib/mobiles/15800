wilkey~
the wilkey~
An angry wilkey stands here, howling at the moon.
~
   This wolf-like creature has shaggy black fur. His teeth are 
large, but his most menacing weapon is his horned snout. 
He doesn't seem happy to see you.
~
A horned creature rears back and howls at the moon.
~
You hear a dog's howl.

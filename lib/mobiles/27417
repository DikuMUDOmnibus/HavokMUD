The Aborigine Warrior~
A Aborigine Warrior is here looking for a Roo to kill.
~
With the exception that his skin is a bit darker than most because of
spending so much time outdoors, he looks very close to many of the
experienced warriors back in town (interesting thing though, he sort of
looks like an Enfan without the bright suit).

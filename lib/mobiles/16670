A Elven warrior~
A Elven warrior stands here guard a doorway into the unknown
~
A tall but slender man, with pointed ears and green almond eyes, stands here
mindlessly fingering his sword and mutter words in a arcane fashion.  He says
in a rich baritone voice "Please go away, I don't have time to talk, I must
guard this portal with my life."

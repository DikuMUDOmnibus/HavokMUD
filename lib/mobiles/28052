Seanderhelm Elf King~
Seanderhelm, the Sea Elf King~
Seanderhelm, the Sea Elf King, sits upon his throne.~
Seanderhelm is quite large for a sea elf, and quite muscular.  He
looks quite confident in his ability to rule.  A sad smile crosses
his face as he gazes upon you, wishing that you would aid his city.

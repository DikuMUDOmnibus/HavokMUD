The Jugglernaut~
A Jugglernaut is here, juggling madly.
~
It is kind of large, some 10 yds in length, walking on several hundred 
tiny legs. It is metallic-looking, with large spots of corrosion 
marring its angular skin. On its sides are large signs, written in an 
incomprehensible language. On its top, a small eye cluster swivels back 
and forth continually.  A number of tentacles are juggling a dizzying
blur of objects.

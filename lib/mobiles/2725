A color pool~
A grassy green color pool can be seen as you approach.
~
     You stand in a grassy meadow with annoyingly cute dandelions
growing here and there.  You hear the merry bubbling of a brook
somewhere ahead, and to the north you see a narrow wooden bridge.  The
scents of perpetual spring either delight or disgust you, depending on
whether you go for the trite stuff like this.

the cook~
A fat giant wipes his grubby hands on his apron as he moves from pot to pot.

This 10' giant is bald and very fat.  A greasy leather apron hangs about his
girth.  He doesn't seem to bright but could tear a man in half without a second
thought.  On his right shoulder is the tattoo of an eye.

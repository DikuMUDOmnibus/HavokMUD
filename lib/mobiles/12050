Auctioneer~
The Auctioneer~
A fast talking man is here offer items to the highest bidder.
~
You can but catch a quick look at this man as he moves about, pointing
and waving.  He speaks so fast that you can't understand what he is
saying.  You do manage to make out a few 'do I hears..' and 'Sold!'
as you look over the items up for auction.
~
The auctioneer points to someone in the crowd and shouts 'Sold!'
~
You hear the rumblings of a crowd and a person speaking rapidly.

A githyanki warlock~
A powerful githyanki stands here preparing a spell to cast at you!
~
  This sickly man sized creature is swathed from head to foot in bandages.
The bandages resemble that of a mummy's, but this creature's are not
as complete.  Pieces are missing here and there, and beneath you glimpse
flesh.  It's eyes glow with a malevolent reddish glow.  It wears 
hooded robe about it's body.

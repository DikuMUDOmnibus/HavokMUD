The Giant bartender~
The bartender stares down at you suspiciously.
~
This giant is at least a little friendly.  He has left the life of a
warrior to maintain the Landman's Inn.  He is always ready with a mug of
beer for his giant and slaver friends.  Something tells him you are
different.. and for now you are not his friend.

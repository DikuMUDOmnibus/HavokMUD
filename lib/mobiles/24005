Delmar~
Delmar Master Thief and Lover~
With his long dark hair and mysterious eyes this lover of the game, be it either thievery or loving stands proudly here~
    Delmar loves all he is, as do most people.  His long hair, 
dark skin, sinfull smile all add to the total package.  He is
quick to steal not only wallets but hearts as well.  He fills
himself with pride at every conquest but the gentleman in him
will not brag of his latest victories.

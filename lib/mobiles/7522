The Slaver Mage~
The slaver mage flies about here.
~
Dressed in fine silks and gleaming jewelry, this painted man has a position
of power among the slavers.  His magic keeps an air-ship aloft, and lets
the crew roam the sky without fear with him.  Such men are the foundation
of the Slaver's industry.

giant firbolg escapee~
A firbolg escapee~
A twelve foot tall humanoid stands before you, eyeing you warily.~
This enormous giant must be the only remaining firbolg in this mountain,
the rest of his kin having been slain by the dopplegangers.  He doesn't
appear as evil as you would expect, but he does eye you very warily.

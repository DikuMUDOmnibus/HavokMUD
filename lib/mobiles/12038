The scribe~
The scribe is here scrawling spells onto scrolls.
~
The scribe is a withered old man with squinty little eyes.  Dispite
his age his hands do not shake as he transfers arcane knowledge 
onto parchment.  It has been said that he can scrawl any spell into
a scroll.  Without looking up from his work he asks how he maybe of
assistance.
~
The scribe hums an ancient tune as he writes.
~
You hear someone humming an odd melody.

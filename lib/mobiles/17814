A wandering dervish~
A wandering dervish stands here, dirty from his long desert journeys.
~
     The dervish is unkempt and dirty, and looks ill-at-ease among
crowds of this size.  He maintains an aloof posture, which is fine with
the rest of the crowd because of his state of (more than normal)
uncleanness.

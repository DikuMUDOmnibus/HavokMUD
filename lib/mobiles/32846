the four-armed snake-man~
A four-armed snake-man swings 2 maces and chants clerical prayers loudly.~
The four-armed snake man is probably a cleric - he carries 2
maces in his lower 2 hands, while waving and praying to his snake
gods with his other 2 hands.  His garb consists of clerical robes,
though they are light and scant and appear to be made of moss.

Dark Master Black~
The Master of The Dark Side~
A man dressed in long black robes stands here, awaiting your arrival.~
The master of the Dark Side has paid the price of his asscention with his health. His face is
pale and gaunt, and his eyes seem sunk in and shallow. Yet they burn with the inner fire of
hatred. A flame not easily extinguished, nor defeated.

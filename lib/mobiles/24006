Arvoreen~
Arvoreen Defender of Righteousness~
Arvoreen the great defender stands here proudly, ready to protect the innocent.~
Arvoreen stands here with a peaceful look upon his face.  When 
looking in his eyes however, one can see the ravages of holy war
have taken their tole.  He is a small, strong man, with the
power of virtue from which he seems to draw his strength.

the ghostly Soldier~
A ghostly soldier makes you cower in dread as he floats nearby.
~
He is covered in ghostly armor, and holds a ghostly sword. There is little
doubt in your mind that this fearsome undead creature will do real damage,
however.
~
You are overcome with a feeling of dread and fear.
~
You suddenly feel VERY uneasy.

An ethereal post~
A tall misty rune-encrypted post floats here in the nothingness.~
Karsinya's Market Square.
   A peculiar looking statue stands in the middle of this square,
as does a large, healthy looking cherry tree.  Judging by the livery
of the guards and pages wandering about, this post must lead to the
Market Square of Karsinya!

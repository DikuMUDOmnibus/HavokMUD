Water Fiend ~
A Water Fiend ~
A Water Fiend swims in the water here and eyes you hungrily. ~
This is a large hulking beast with bat wings and talon like fangs,
webbed fingers and toes ending in viscious claws, and a slimy coating
of seaweed.  Its skin looks quite slippery and is made of metallic
looking fish scales.

ghoul~
the ghoul~
A slime covered ghoul savagely tears into the ground looking for food.

This agile creature was once a man.  Now it is a hideous servant of darkness.
A red glow radiates from its eyes and its longs hooked teeth drip with a yellow
slime.  Its only sustenance is the flesh of the living and dead.

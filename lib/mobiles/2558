Large Ghoul~
A large ghoul~
A large ghoul turns and leers at you, seeing his next meal..~
This agile creature was once a man.  Now it is a hideous servant
of darkness.  A red glow radiates from its eyes and its long hooked
teeth drip with a yellow slime.  Its only sustenance is the flesh
of the living.. and the soon to be dead!

Zaknafein Do'Urden~
Zaknafein Do'Urden glares at you through empty eye sockets. ~
  Once a fine specimen of a dark elf, Zaknafein has since died and
been raised as an undead servant to House Do'Urden.  He looks to be
only a tattered remnant of what he used to be.. but the way he wields
his weapons proves otherwise!

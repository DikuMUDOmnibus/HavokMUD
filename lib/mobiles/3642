the wandering prophet~
A small gray-harried man walks around spouting gospel.
~
This sad case may have been an evangelist in another lifetime. He is known
to stand on corners and accost passers-by with his doomsday preaching.
~
The wandering prophet bellows ' REPENT! The world is coming to an end!'
~
You hear some preaching nearby.

the Snow Snake~
The huge, bulky Snow Snake is here.
~
The Large Snow Snake lies here staring at you with beady red eyes. The scales
that armor its body are such a bright white that he is almost
impossible to see against the snow in which he sleeps.  As you enter he
stirs from his sleep and coils...prepared to ATTACK!!!!!!!

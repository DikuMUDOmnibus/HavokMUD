Bangfizzle wanders behind the counter, trying to make new magic items

She is wearing tattered brown robes, and seems to be having a
conversation with the her beakers.  All the more disturbing
because the beakers occasionally explode with a thunderous roar.

Bangfizzle says 'Oops, guess that those weren't the right chemicals.
~
You hear an explosion nearby.

The King of the Giants~
The Lord of the Cloud Giants holds court here.
~
Lord over all the cloud giants, in fact over most giants period. He displays a
good deal of commanding power and shows his power repeatedly. The King is
always ready to test his mettle against the best.  He leans back in throne
imperiously, as if mocking your indiscretion in entering HIS domain.  He
fingers his axe, itching to make your visit short indeed.

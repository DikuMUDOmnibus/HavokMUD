A large nomad guard~
A rather large nomad watches you, his two-handed scimitar close at hand.
~
     This nomad is larger than most of the other nomads you've seen.  He
looks very strong, and appears to know how to use that two-handed
scimitar he holds ready.  He follows you with his his gaze, waiting for
any possible hostile action.

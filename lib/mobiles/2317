A foreman~
A foreman overwatches the workers as they work to build the castle.
~
  This man looks like he is too arrogant for the good of his workers.  He is
constantly degrading and berating the workers on being to slow.  If he would
only work as hard as he yells, they might have the castle done within the year.

Littlefinger the thief guildmaster~
Littlefinger the thief guildmaster is barely visible here.~
Littlefinger is very small in stature, but very powerful nonetheless.
He wears a simple black cloak, black boots, and the hood of his 
cloak covers his facial features.  He has a simple looking dagger
strapped to his side, but is known to have NEVER missed his mark.

snake statue guard~
A guardian snake~
A guardian snake slithers about here
~
	This snake looks like it has some intelligence. It's head
sways left to right following your movements carefully. The hide of this
snake looks like stone, you would almost be fooled into believing it
was a statue if it did not move.

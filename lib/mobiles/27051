ogre smith~
the ogre~
An ogre stands by the anvil trying to figure out which end of the hammer to use
~
This ogre got the thankless job of "master smith."  His swords are as dull as
his mind.  By the looks of his hands he has yet to figure out that the tongs
are used to pull the hot iron from the furnace.  On the top of his head is the
tattoo of an eye.

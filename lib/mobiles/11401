A Sundhaven Guard~
A guard of Sundhaven Stands watchfully.~

His swarthy human face is framed by well-combed dark hair that gazes
about with a relaxed, alert air. He wears in his uniform the dark gold
and black colors of the town banner, and the sword that hangs from
his hip looks more than idle decoration.

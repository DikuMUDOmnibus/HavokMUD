The Avatar of Blibdoolpoolp~
The Avatar of Blibdoolpoolp stands here, ready to tear you to shreds!~
The Avatar of Blibdoolpoolp is a horrible sight to behold!  It is an
amorphous blob, quite large, covered in flames and a bright white light.
It has eight long, black tentacles protruding from its mass, ready to
club you to a pulp!  The avatar is quite unhappy at having been imprisoned
here for so long!

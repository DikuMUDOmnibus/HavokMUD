the Frost Giant~
The Frost Giant is here playing in the snow.
~
The Frost Giant has long woolly looking fur all about his body. His eyes are
dark and hollow as if no one or thing is behind them. He stands about 15 feet
tall and 400 pounds. It is quite obvious that such a large creature requires a
lot of food. He smiles hungrily at you!!

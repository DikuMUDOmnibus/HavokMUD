Queeklor, God of the Rats~
Queeklor, God of the Rats has seen you, flee!
~
You are lucky if you come up to Queeklor's knees.  From beneath
his snout, rancid breath assaults your nose, its stench unbearable.
Boy, you wish you had a breath mint about now.
~
Queeklor, God of the Rats, looks at you.
~
You hear the sound of a enormous rat.

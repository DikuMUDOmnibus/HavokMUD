elf undead zombie~
a decomposing elf~
A decomposing elf corpse lies here in this room.

  It appears this fellow was not as lucky as you are. Looking at the 
remains you can see that it has been dead quiet sometime now and is
really beginning to smell. Two large holes are the only thing that
seem to be wrong with the corpse.

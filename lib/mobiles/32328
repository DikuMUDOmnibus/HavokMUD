Chadkranther the Undead Bard~
Chadkranther the giant Undead Bard looms here ominously.~
   Chadkranther is a hill giant of bigger than normal size, with
muscles rippling across his broad chest and arms.  He is, how-
ever, dead...  his eye sockets would be empty but for the evil
red glow emanating from within, and the muscles appear to be 
stretched across the large bones with no skin to cover them...

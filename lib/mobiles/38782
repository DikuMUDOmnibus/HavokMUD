A Tortured Basilisk ~
A tortured basilisk rest here in anticipation of its next arena kill. ~
The basilisk is a reptilian monster with eight legs and a strong
toothy jaw.  It is a steely blue and brown colored beast, and its
eyes glow a deadly pale green.  It shows the signs of many combats,
and it just may live to see many more!

Hercules~
Hercules is resting here, tired from his many labors.
~
Hercules is wearing only a Large belt and shorts about his waist.  He is
definitely the largest man you have ever seen.  He is wielding a Huge
club that is made from the finest wood in all of Graecia.  His muscles
are so huge that it looks like he could crush you by flexing.

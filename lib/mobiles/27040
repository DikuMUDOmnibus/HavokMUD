phantom man ghostly~
the phantom~
The ghostly form of a old man is desperately pulling the rope ringing the bell.
~
The ghost is of an old man in wizardly clothes.  His hair is a mess and his
face is beading with sweat.  Wild eyes stare out over the valley as he
continues ringing the huge ball in complete desperation.
~
The old ghost scream out to the forest below,'Flee! Flee from your homes!'
~
You hear a man desperately shouting not too far away.

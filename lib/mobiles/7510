Keeper Demon Keep~
The Keeper of the Sword~
The Demon keeper of the sword of King Syagrius stands here grinning.
~
Blocking the way to the glowing holy sword is a terrible demon!  It grins
horribly at you, as if to say, "You shall fail like all before."
~
The demon gibbers insanely.
~
Demonic noises come from nearby.  Fear quivers through you.

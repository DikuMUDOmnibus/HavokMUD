A color pool~
A green and yellow color pool can be seen as you approach.

Over the years, litter and debris has built up in here from the prey of
the crawlers. All sorts of bones, human and otherwise, are heaped and piled
here and there. A large sinkhole in the middle of the cave has acquired some
water from somewhere and you see a strange glow coming from the bottom of the
hole.

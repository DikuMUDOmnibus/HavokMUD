the Tendrculos~
A writhing mass of vines and vegetation lurches towards you and attacks!~
   This large mass of vegetative matter looks to be nothing more than a small
hillock.  If it hadn't moved you would have walked right over it, and most likely
died in the process.  It is impossible to tell if this foul creature was mutated by 
dark magic, or may have originated on another plane of existence.  Regardless, 
it is rearing itself up before you resembling a huge, eyeless beast with wicked 
teeth and long tendrils that it uses to grab and paralyze its pray before swallowing
them whole.  Perhaps now would be a good time to run...

An Ethereal Post~
A tall misty rune-encrypted post floats here in the nothingness.~
   Through the misty post you see what must be the Central Bazaar
of Tarantis, though none of the usual crowd is visible, and the
normally bright colorful atmosphere there seems quite dulled.
Local militia and Tarantian Soldiers are seen, proudly displaying
the black and white colors of Tarantis.

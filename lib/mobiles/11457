basilisk guard guardian~
A Guardian Basilisk~
A Basilisk summoned from the ether guards a doorway.~

The guardian stands motionless with eyes of stone fixed on the far
wall. Nonetheless, this reptile, a figure born of a cold wisdom,
knows well enough if you are worthy to pass into the guild of
priests.

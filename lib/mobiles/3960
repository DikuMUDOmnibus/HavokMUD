An enormous Octopus~
An inky blob floats around the lair, several tentacles spreading out from it.~
Upon closer inspection, this seems to be a very large octopus. While
you're watching, its huge, single eye opens and turns its attention
to you. At first surpirsed, soon it understands a neat little snack
may just have entered its lair.

You hear some snarling and heavy breathing, but you don't know where it 
is coming from.

This thing is HUGE and it looks like it can adapt to anything. It has a tail
four legs, two wings, scales, etc etc. Oh, did I mention the fangs,

You hear it, but you don't see it. Where is it, you don't know but it scares you!

You hear something that really makes you nervous close by.

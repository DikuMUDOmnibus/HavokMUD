Captain Saltmere~
Captain Saltmere stands here, watching over his ship.
~
The patch over his eye and the many scars lining his face tell you that you
are looking at a well experienced veteran.
~
The Captain screams at the Helmsman as he makes a wrong turn.
~
You here yelling and screaming in the distance.

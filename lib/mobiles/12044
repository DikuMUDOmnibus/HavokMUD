summoner shopkeeper~
The town Summoner~
An old man stands here calling forth people and objects from all over.
~
The town Summoner is a strange old coot.  He stutters and bubbles about,
complaining of the late night requests he keeps getting for a summoning.
He blindly stumbles into you as he wonders about.  He apologizes and 
informs you that he can't summon you here, there would be no point in it!

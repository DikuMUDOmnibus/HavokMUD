The Swamp Thing~
The Swamp Thing stands here oozing.
~
You see a horrific pile of oozing slime, with an eerie yellow glow coming
from the twin sockets of its eyes. The bulk of this creature seems to be
made of the decomposing bodies of those who have died in the swamp, along
with large amounts of mud and vegetable material. He shows no sense of any
recognition, he seems to attack you out of nature.

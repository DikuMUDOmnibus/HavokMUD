a slave girl~
A tired and beaten slave child goes about her duties.
~
The slave girl is little more than a rag doll.  She pitifully sweeps the
floor and cries about her lost parents.  If you ask her name she says it is
Cosette. 
~
The child sings about her castle on a cloud, where crying is not allowed.
~
You here the wretched singing of a crying child.

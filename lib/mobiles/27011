the black annis~
The tall form of the black annis stands here trying to look useful.
~
Nine feet tall and covered in blue-black skin, this "lady" is half green hag
and half giant.  Although magic is weak in her blood her demon ancestry
gives her great power and great wickedness.
~
The black annis grins with a mouthful of crooked, yellow teeth.
~
A foul screach breaks is the silence of the forest.

The charmed snake~
A snake arises from the basket, swaying in time to the music.
~
     This large sandy-brown snake is swinging back and forth, bobbing
its head as the snake charmer plays his flute.  You notice the snake's
pointed fangs and understand why the snake charmer has such a look of
concentration on his face.
~
The snake writhes and bobs with the flute music.

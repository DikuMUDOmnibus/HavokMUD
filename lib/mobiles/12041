Ol' Salty shopkeeper ~
Ol' Salty~
An old broken down sailor is here selling sea faring vessels.
~
Weather beaten and withered, Salty passes the days buy making and
selling boats and rafts.  Though once a mighty sailor, Salty is
nothing more than an old braggart drinking his life into oblivion.
He catches you staring at him and offers to hang you from the yard
arm, whatever that is.
~
Aye me harties, they be the finest ships on the sea!
~
You hear someone engaged in a drunken sailor song.

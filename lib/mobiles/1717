Ron the monk~
Ron the monk is sitting here drinking some beer and telling army stories.
~
   This particular fellow has close cropped hair that came from when he was
serving in Shadowdale's Cityguards. He also seems to be able put down a good
amount of beer as he is often draining his mug.
~
Ron the monk chuckles over some joke, raises his mug, declares "Compai!",
   drains his mug, and then refills it from a small beer barrel.
~
You here some muffled laughter nearby (kind of like a party).

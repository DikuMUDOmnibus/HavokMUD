A Shadowborne~
A Shadowborne glides towards you, barely a ripple in the darkness.~
Shadows of shadows, this fell creature is barely visible even to
the most magical and well-trained eye...  occasional glimpses of
black ivory claws or teeth send shivers down even the heartiest
of souls, and the whispery breath of this creature can cause
a mighty warrior's heart to stop beating.

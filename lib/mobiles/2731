A color pool~
A murky gray color pool can be seen as you approach.

    This is a twisty underground tunnel with many exits and entrances.
The ground is more or less even, but the passage walls are so similar in
kind that it is impossible to differentiate one passage from another by them.
There are exits leading in all four compass directions. The tunnel floor
has been worn smooth by the passage of many feet.

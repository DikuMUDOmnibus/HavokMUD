A Living Wall~
A wall of stone-bricks stands here splitting the chamber in half.~
The wall originally appeared to be made of stone, but your closer
look reveals it is actually of greying sinewy flesh.  Teeth, eyes,
broken bones, and toes jut from it's surface, and moans of pain
and terror erupt from it's surface.

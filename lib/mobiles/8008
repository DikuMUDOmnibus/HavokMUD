butterfly fly~
the butterfly~
A beautiful, butterfly-like thing is fluttering around here.
~
It is, on closer inspection, not really an animal, but a variable 
number of brightly-colored, translucent planes of breathtaking beauty 
and delicacy. The planes pulse, waver, sometimes disappear, but are 
always replaced by another. None of the planes move, but through 
continuous replacement, the butterfly does, in random sweeps.

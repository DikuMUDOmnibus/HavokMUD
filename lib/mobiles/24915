Fear statue~
The statue of Fear~
A statue stands in the fountain.

Here is the statue of the Lowly Saint.  After spending millennia with
greater spirits, this small figment of Fear's mind was formed.  Fear
extends his deepest thanks to the defender of green kobolds and this
statue emanates great undreamed of power.

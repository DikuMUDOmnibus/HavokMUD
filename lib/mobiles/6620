The Master of Arms~
The Master of Arms is here, wondering why he has to train nincompoops.

He is well seasoned in the ways of war.  Scars cover most of his exposed
torso, and tattoos pretty much get the rest.  He is equally comfortable
with virtually any weapon, but he prefers to pummel people with his
iron-like fists.

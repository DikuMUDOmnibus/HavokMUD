A githyanki soldier~
An armored form wrapped in rotting bandages glares at you for intruding.
~
  This sickly man sized creature is swathed from head to foot in bandages.
The bandages resemble that of a mummy's, but this creature's are not
as complete.  Pieces are missing here and there, and beneath you glimpse
flesh.  It's eyes glow with a malevolent reddish glow.  It wears an
ornate suit of banded mail and wields a silvery blade.

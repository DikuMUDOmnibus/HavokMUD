A color pool~
A gray color pool can be seen as you approach.

   You are now standing on the drawbridge of an ancient castle. Two huge
statues of some strange creature float in mid-air directly above the pit
beneath the drawbridge on which you now stand. You can't see any farther
than the inside of the entrance, for the castle appears to be totally
without light.

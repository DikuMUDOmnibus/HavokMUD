John the Lumberjack~
John the Lumberjack is here, looking for some trees to chop down.
~
He is six feet tall and looks quite strong, muscles bulging under his heavy,
checkered shirt.  His features are worn with hard work and his expression is
one of a peaceful man leading a simple life.
~
John says 'I'm a lumberjack, and I'm ok.'
~
You hear someone singing nearby.

The Aborigine Elder~
The Aborigine Elder is fiddling with some strange flasks.
~
This wizened aborigine is obviously more than just some backwoods
mumbo-jumbo man.
~
The Elder curses as a flask shatters upon the floor.
A strange odor fills the room.
~
You hear the crash of breaking glass and muffled cursing.

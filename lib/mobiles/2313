Jaroo Ashstaff stands here, one with nature.

  It is said that this man is in possession of some knowledge that you might
need.  Then again, it could have been a rumor.  
  Jaroo is a druid.  He looks well placed in this wooded area.  The large 
black bear at his side throws off any further doubts to his profession.

Jaroo syays, 'At the bottom of the moathouse is a man with key to temple.'
~
You can see a man in a clearing to the north, becoming one with nature.

An immense Theronian guard is righting any wrongs for good.

This guard is so muscle-bound that he can't put his arms down to his
side. He notices you and yawns and stretches, snapping a few straps on
his armor. Maybe you had better move along, he doesn't look like he
is in the mood to be bothered by little 'ole you.

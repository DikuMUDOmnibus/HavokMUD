Hecate~
The twisted form of Hecate stands here working forbidden magics!
~
She is no more than a twisted old crone.  Her long, hook nose is covered
with warts.  Her skin is dry and scaly.  Her hair: no more than black, matted
knots.  "Welcome, my child," her cracked voice beckons.
~
Hecate glares at you,'Begone fools!'
~
A cold chill passes over you.

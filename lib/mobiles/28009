Ixitxachitl~
An Ixitxachitl~
An Ixitxachitl glides silently towards you, barbed tail poised and ready to strike.~
This frightening creature looks much like a giant manta ray, with
a wingspan of approximately twelve feet!  It sports a long, barbed
tail which looks like it could deal out some damage.

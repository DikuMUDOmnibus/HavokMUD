The Vampire Lord~
A tall dark being stands before you, on his face is a look of sorrow and 
regret that he must kill you now.
~
  This is the Lord of the Vampires.  He was once a handsome man, who lived
a simple life as a druid.  Once too often however, he indulged in sinful, 
evil acts and at his death, his soul was captured by the Temple's evil and
twisted into this creature.  He looks down at you regretfully, as if he did
not want to kill you.  He nods at you, a small gesture of respect, before
he attacks!

The Gypsy Child~
A Gypsy Child runs around here, bugging the hell out of you.
~
You see a small child dressed in gypsy garb. From his state of hyperactivity,
you assume that Gypsies must have a lot of sugar in their diet.
~
The Gypsy Child says 'Ya wanna play?'
~
You hear a child babbling nearby.

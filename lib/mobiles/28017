Aboleth~
The Giant Aboleth~
An aboleth, huge even for his race, swims about.~
This loathsome amphibious creature resembles a plump fish, 40 feet
from its bulbous head to its fluke-like tail.  Its body is blue-green
with gray splotches.  Four leathery tentacles, each fifteen feet in
length, grow from its head.

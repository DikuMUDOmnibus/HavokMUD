The sea-elf guard~
Wearing a disgruntled look, this sea-elf guard counts his coins.~
This sea-elf is on guard duty. Since visitors to the Coral Tower are
scarce, he spends most of his time gambling away his money. He's not
terribly bright, or he would have started to wonder why he's losing
all the time. Ah well.

gritha dancing~
a gritha~
A gritha dances madly about the fire, chanting in a barbaric tongue.
~
This creature looks like a harry, winged goblin standing almost five feet tall.
Its eyes are wild and it's teeth yellow and barred as it prances about.
~
The gritha screaches with fury and howls at the sky.
~
An evil chant echos around you.

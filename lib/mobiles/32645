The Undead General Wargrave~
The Undead General Wargrave's corpse lies within it's sarcophgus.~
   The undead General Wargrave was once a large and powerfull man.
He is now a sallow wasted version of his prior self - probably
because he is DEAD.  His bones are draped with crumbling clothing
of a once rich nature, and his armor no longer gleams with it's
polished brightness.  His eyes, however, gleam with a light most
unholy, and an evil laughter can be heard faintly from within
his dead carapace.

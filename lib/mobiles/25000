The Demi-Lich~
The Demi-Lich leaps from his throne as you enter the room, his evil
eyes fixed dead upon you!
~
The Demi-Lich is, perhaps, the single most powerful undead creature known
to exist.  Greatly resembling a wight or mummy, and being gaunt and skeletal
in form. It is, nevertheless a being of foreboding might. Its eye sockets
are black and empty, save for the fierce pinpoints of light which serve as
eyes. An aura of cold and darkness radiates from it, which makes it an 
ominous and fearsome sight. Despite the wasted, rotten flesh it is garbed
in the rich clothes of nobility.

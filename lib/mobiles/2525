With an old pot for a helm, this little orcish raider is ready for some fun.

This is a little orc, just barely walking.  He is ready to follow in his
father's footsteps and loot and pillage.  He is looking for something or
someone to loot.  Perhaps you would care to oblige him? He is only a 
little kid after all...

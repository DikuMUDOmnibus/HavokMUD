Newnar Ackbar shopkeeper~
Newnar Ackbar~
Newnar Ackbar stares out at you from the shadows.
~
You can not see Newnar's face as he keeps it well hidden in the 
shadow's of his dark shop.  It is said he is in league with Wylie
Baker himself, but there is no solid evidence of this.  With a 
whispery snarl he tells you to get what you need and be on your way.

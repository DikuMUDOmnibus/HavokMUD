Keftab, the Ancient One~
Keftab, the Ancient One stands here, calmly searching ceaslessly.
~
A writhing, quivering mass of horrific, unspeakable flesh-like material, this
ancient one stares coldly about through its many multifacted eyes.
viscous, vile smelling liquid seeps through its flesh in many places,
originating from the ghastly, crater like pores which pepper his body.
Disgustingly, large portions of its flesh seem to bubble with an alien
life of their own. The surface of its body, where not oozing, is covered
with mottled, grey, mossy protrusions, like some strange malignant
blemishes. It emits low, guttural mewlings from its fanged, quivering
orifice.

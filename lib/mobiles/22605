Timnus~
Timnus the Protector stands here.
~
Timnus is the mightiest elf of all time.  He smiles at young adventurers,
wishing them well on their journeys.  He turns his gaze to you, and decides
whether or not you are worthy to pass.
~
Timnus says 'Only the truly young may pass.'
~
You hear a merrily whistled tune.

The Avatar of Posereisn~
The Avatar of Posereisn floats here, a melancholy smile upon his face.~
The Avatar of Posereisn is a noble humanoid, approximately twenty
feet tall.  He does the will of Posereisn, the Sea Elf Deity in this
region.  However, he is quite unhappy with his imprisonment and the
war waged upon his followers by the evil Kua-Toa.

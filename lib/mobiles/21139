the ghostly Lieutenant~
You cover your eyes in horror as you see the ghostly lieutenant.
~
He radiates with a red glow, through which you can see he is covered in
armor, which also seems to be spiritual in nature. He has such a fearsome
visage that just looking at him makes you shiver in dread.
~
You are overcome with a feeling of dread and fear.
~
You suddenly feel EXTREMELY uneasy.

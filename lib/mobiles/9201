Hill Giant Chieftain~
the Hill Giant Chieftain~
The Chieftain of the Hill Giants is standing here.
~
The largest and meanest looking Hill Giant you have ever seen stands before
you. He has the scars from many bodies across his body. He is wearing some
hides of a very large dragon. He returns you look with a look of pure and utter
hatred.

The Maester of Winterfell's Arena~
Winterfell's Maester of the Arena stands here~
   The Maester of the Arena is a rather plain looking human,
with a quick smile and a friendly handshake.  He wears the bold
insignia of Winterfell, a black Direwolf on a snow white back-
ground.  He offers encouragement willingly to those preparing
for combat.

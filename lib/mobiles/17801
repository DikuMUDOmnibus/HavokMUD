The merchant~
The merchant shows you his goods, eyeing your coin pouch in anticipation.
~
     The merchant is dressed in somewhat richer robes than the common
passerby outside.  He happily points to one item, then the next, all the
while babbling a stream of compliments and encouragement. Judging from
the gleam in his eye he is eager to make another sale.
~
The merchant shoves an item in your face, telling you an incredible price.
~
A merchant calls to you from a nearby stall, hawking his goods.

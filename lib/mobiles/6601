Sir Lancelot du Lac~
Standing here is Lancelot du Lac, the greatest among mortal men.
~
He looks like he has been fighting all of his life, and has yet to lose.
The courage in his cold, gray eyes is unmistakable.  Enormous muscles
bulge on his arms, and his chest appears slightly larger than the last
wine barrel you saw.  Having this man for an enemy is about the worst 
mistake one might make.
